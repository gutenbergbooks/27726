<h2>PART I</h2>

<h1>TOLSTOY ON SHAKESPEARE</h1>




<h2>I</h2><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Crosby's article<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on Shakespeare's
attitude toward the working classes suggested
to me the idea of also expressing my own long-established
opinion about the works of Shakespeare,
in direct opposition, as it is, to that
established in all the whole European world.
Calling to mind all the struggle of doubt and
self-deceit,&mdash;efforts to attune myself to Shakespeare&mdash;which
I went through owing to my
complete disagreement with this universal
adulation, and, presuming that many have
experienced and are experiencing the same, I
think that it may not be unprofitable to express
definitely and frankly this view of mine,
opposed to that of the majority, and the more
so as the conclusions to which I came, when
examining the causes of my disagreement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
with the universally established opinion, are,
it seems to me, not without interest and significance.</p>

<p>My disagreement with the established opinion
about Shakespeare is not the result of an accidental
frame of mind, nor of a light-minded
attitude toward the matter, but is the outcome
of many years' repeated and insistent endeavors
to harmonize my own views of Shakespeare
with those established amongst all
civilized men of the Christian world.</p>

<p>I remember the astonishment I felt when I
first read Shakespeare. I expected to receive
a powerful esthetic pleasure, but having read,
one after the other, works regarded as his best:
"King Lear," "Romeo and Juliet," "Hamlet"
and "Macbeth," not only did I feel no delight,
but I felt an irresistible repulsion and tedium,
and doubted as to whether I was senseless in
feeling works regarded as the summit of perfection
by the whole of the civilized world to
be trivial and positively bad, or whether the
significance which this civilized world attributes
to the works of Shakespeare was itself
senseless. My consternation was increased
by the fact that I always keenly felt the beauties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of poetry in every form; then why should
artistic works recognized by the whole world
as those of a genius,&mdash;the works of Shakespeare,&mdash;not
only fail to please me, but be
disagreeable to me? For a long time I could
not believe in myself, and during fifty years,
in order to test myself, I several times recommenced
reading Shakespeare in every possible
form, in Russian, in English, in German and
in Schlegel's translation, as I was advised.
Several times I read the dramas and the comedies
and historical plays, and I invariably
underwent the same feelings: repulsion, weariness,
and bewilderment. At the present time,
before writing this preface, being desirous
once more to test myself, I have, as an old man
of seventy-five, again read the whole of Shakespeare,
including the historical plays, the
"Henrys," "Troilus and Cressida," the "Tempest,"
"Cymbeline," and I have felt, with even
greater force, the same feelings,&mdash;this time,
however, not of bewilderment, but of firm,
indubitable conviction that the unquestionable
glory of a great genius which Shakespeare
enjoys, and which compels writers of our time
to imitate him and readers and spectators to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
discover in him non-existent merits,&mdash;thereby
distorting their esthetic and ethical understanding,&mdash;is
a great evil, as is every untruth.</p>

<p>Altho I know that the majority of people so
firmly believe in the greatness of Shakespeare
that in reading this judgment of mine they
will not admit even the possibility of its justice,
and will not give it the slightest attention,
nevertheless I will endeavor, as well as I can,
to show why I believe that Shakespeare can
not be recognized either as a great genius, or
even as an average author.</p>

<p>For illustration of my purpose I will take one
of Shakespeare's most extolled dramas, "King
Lear," in the enthusiastic praise of which, the
majority of critics agree.</p>

<p>"The tragedy of Lear is deservedly celebrated
among the dramas of Shakespeare,"
says Dr. Johnson. "There is perhaps no
play which keeps the attention so strongly
fixed, which so much agitates our passions,
and interests our curiosity."</p>

<p>"We wish that we could pass this play over
and say nothing about it," says Hazlitt, "all
that we can say must fall far short of the subject,
or even of what we ourselves conceive of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
it. To attempt to give a description of the
play itself, or of its effects upon the mind, is
mere impertinence; yet we must say something.
It is, then, the best of Shakespeare's plays, for
it is the one in which he was the most in earnest."</p>

<p>"If the originality of invention did not so
much stamp almost every play of Shakespeare,"
says Hallam, "that to name one as the most
original seems a disparagement to others, we
might say that this great prerogative of genius,
was exercised above all in 'Lear.' It diverges
more from the model of regular tragedy than
'Macbeth,' or 'Othello,' and even more
than 'Hamlet,' but the fable is better constructed
than in the last of these and it displays
full as much of the almost superhuman inspiration
of the poet as the other two."</p>

<p>"'King Lear' may be recognized as the perfect
model of the dramatic art of the whole
world," says Shelley.</p>

<p>"I am not minded to say much of Shakespeare's
Arthur," says Swinburne. "There
are one or two figures in the world of his work
of which there are no words that would be fit
or good to say. Another of these is Cordelia.
The place they have in our lives and thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
is not one for talk. The niche set apart for
them to inhabit in our secret hearts is not
penetrable by the lights and noises of common
day. There are chapels in the cathedrals of
man's highest art, as in that of his inmost life,
not made to be set open to the eyes and feet
of the world. Love, and Death, and Memory,
keep charge for us in silence of some beloved
names. It is the crowning glory of genius,
the final miracle and transcendent gift of poetry,
that it can add to the number of these and engrave
on the very heart of our remembrance
fresh names and memories of its own creation."</p>

<p>"Lear is the occasion for Cordelia," says
Victor Hugo. "Maternity of the daughter
toward the father; profound subject; maternity
venerable among all other maternities,
so admirably rendered by the legend of that
Roman girl, who, in the depths of a prison,
nurses her old father. The young breast near
the white beard! There is not a spectacle
more holy. This filial breast is Cordelia.
Once this figure dreamed of and found, Shakespeare
created his drama.... Shakespeare,
carrying Cordelia in his thoughts, created that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
tragedy like a god who, having an aurora to
put forward, makes a world expressly for it."</p>

<p>"In 'King Lear,' Shakespeare's vision sounded
the abyss of horror to its very depths,
and his spirit showed neither fear, nor giddiness,
nor faintness, at the sight," says Brandes. "On
the threshold of this work, a feeling of awe
comes over one, as on the threshold of the
Sistine Chapel, with its ceiling of frescoes by
Michael Angelo,&mdash;only that the suffering here
is far more intense, the wail wilder, and the
harmonies of beauty more definitely shattered
by the discords of despair."</p>

<p>Such are the judgments of the critics about
this drama, and therefore I believe I am not
wrong in selecting it as a type of Shakespeare's
best.</p>

<p>As impartially as possible, I will endeavor
to describe the contents of the drama, and then
to show why it is not that acme of perfection
it is represented to be by critics, but is something
quite different.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h2>II</h2>

<p>The drama of "Lear" begins with a scene
giving the conversation between two courtiers,
Kent and Gloucester. Kent, pointing to a
young man present, asks Gloucester whether
that is not his son. Gloucester says that he
has often blushed to acknowledge the young
man as his son, but has now ceased doing so.
Kent says he "can not conceive him." Then
Gloucester in the presence of this son of his
says: "The fellow's mother could, and grew
round-wombed, and had a son for her cradle
ere she had a husband for her bed." "I have
another, a legitimate son," continues Gloucester,
"but altho this one came into the world
before he was sent for, his mother was fair
and there was good sport at his making, and
therefore I acknowledge this one also."</p>

<p>Such is the introduction. Not to mention
the coarseness of these words of Gloucester,
they are, farther, out of place in the mouth of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
person intended to represent a noble character.
One can not agree with the opinion of some
critics that these words are given to Gloucester
in order to show the contempt for his illegitimacy
from which Edmund suffers. Were
this so, it would first have been unnecessary
to make the father express the contempt felt
by men in general, and, secondly, Edmund, in
his monolog about the injustice of those
who despise him for his birth, would have
mentioned such words from his father. But
this is not so, and therefore these words of
Gloucester at the very beginning of the piece,
were merely intended as a communication
to the public&mdash;in a humorous form&mdash;of the
fact that Gloucester has a legitimate son and
an illegitimate one.</p>

<p>After this, trumpets are blown, and King
Lear enters with his daughters and sons-in-law,
and utters a speech to the effect that, owing
to old age, he wishes to retire from the cares
of business and divide his kingdom between
his daughters. In order to know how much
he should give to each daughter, he announces
that to the one who says she loves him most
he will give most. The eldest daughter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Goneril, says that words can not express the
extent of her love, that she loves her father
more than eyesight, space, and liberty, loves
him so much that it "makes her breath poor."
King Lear immediately allots his daughter
on the map, her portion of fields, woods, rivers,
and meadows, and asks the same question of
the second daughter. The second daughter,
Regan, says that her sister has correctly expressed
her own feelings, only not strongly
enough. She, Regan, loves her father so much
that everything is abhorrent to her except his
love. The king rewards this daughter, also,
and then asks his youngest, the favorite, in
whom, according to his expression, are "interess'd
the vines of France and the milk of
Burgundy," that is, whose hand is being
claimed by the King of France and the Duke of
Burgundy,&mdash;he asks Cordelia how she loves
him. Cordelia, who personifies all the virtues,
as the eldest two all the vices, says, quite out of
place, as if on purpose to irritate her father,
that altho she loves and honors him, and is
grateful to him, yet if she marries, all her love
will not belong to her father, but she will also
love her husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Hearing these words, the King loses his
temper, and curses this favorite daughter with
the most dreadful and strange maledictions,
saying, for instance, that he will henceforth
love his daughter as little as he loves the man
who devours his own children.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The barbarous Scythian,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or he that makes his generation messes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou, my sometime daughter."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The courtier, Kent, defends Cordelia, and
desiring to appease the King, rebukes him for
his injustice, and says reasonable things about
the evil of flattery. Lear, unmoved by Kent,
banishes him under pain of death, and calling
to him Cordelia's two suitors, the Duke of
Burgundy and the King of France, proposes to
them in turn to take Cordelia without dowry.
The Duke of Burgundy frankly says that without
dowry he will not take Cordelia, but the
King of France takes her without dowry and
leads her away. After this, the elder sisters,
there and then entering into conversation,
prepare to injure their father who had endowed
them. Thus ends the first scene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Not to mention the pompous, characterless
language of King Lear, the same in which all
Shakespeare's Kings speak, the reader, or
spectator, can not conceive that a King, however
old and stupid he may be, could believe
the words of the vicious daughters, with whom
he had passed his whole life, and not believe
his favorite daughter, but curse and banish
her; and therefore the spectator, or reader, can
not share the feelings of the persons participating
in this unnatural scene.</p>

<p>The second scene opens with Edmund,
Gloucester's illegitimate son, soliloquizing on
the injustice of men, who concede rights and
respect to the legitimate son, but deprive the
illegitimate son of them, and he determines to
ruin Edgar, and to usurp his place. For this
purpose, he forges a letter to himself as from
Edgar, in which the latter expresses a desire
to murder his father. Awaiting his father's
approach, Edmund, as if against his will,
shows him this letter, and the father immediately
believes that his son Edgar, whom he
tenderly loves, desires to kill him. The father
goes away, Edgar enters and Edmund persuades
him that his father for some reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
desires to kill him. Edgar immediately believes
this and flees from his parent.</p>

<p>The relations between Gloucester and his
two sons, and the feelings of these characters
are as unnatural as Lear's relation to his
daughters, or even more so, and therefore it is
still more difficult for the spectator to transport
himself into the mental condition of Gloucester
and his sons and sympathize with them, than
it is to do so into that of Lear and his daughters.</p>

<p>In the fourth scene, the banished Kent, so
disguised that Lear does not recognize him,
presents himself to Lear, who is already staying
with Goneril. Lear asks who he is, to which
Kent answers, one doesn't know why, in a tone
quite inappropriate to his position: "A very
honest-hearted fellow and as poor as the King."&mdash;"If
thou be as poor for a subject as he is for
a King, thou art poor enough&mdash;How old art
thou?" asks the King. "Not so young, Sir,
to love a woman, <i>etc.</i>, nor so old to dote on her."
To this the King says, "If I like thee no worse
after dinner, I will not part from thee yet."</p>

<p>These speeches follow neither from Lear's
position, nor his relation to Kent, but are put
into the mouths of Lear and Kent, evidently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
because the author regards them as witty and
amusing.</p>

<p>Goneril's steward appears, and behaves
rudely to Lear, for which Kent knocks him
down. The King, still not recognizing Kent,
gives him money for this and takes him into
his service. After this appears the fool, and
thereupon begins a prolonged conversation
between the fool and the King, utterly unsuited
to the position and serving no purpose. Thus,
for instance, the fool says, "Give me an egg
and I'll give thee two crowns." The King
asks, "What crowns shall they be?"&mdash;"Why,"
says the fool, "after I have cut the egg i' the
middle, and eat up the meat, the two crowns
of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i'
the middle, and gavest away both parts, thou
borest thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt: thou
hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou
gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like
myself in this, let him be whipp'd that first
finds it so."</p>

<p>In this manner lengthy conversations go on
calling forth in the spectator or reader that
wearisome uneasiness which one experiences
when listening to jokes which are not witty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>This conversation was interrupted by the
approach of Goneril. She demands of her
father that he should diminish his retinue;
that he should be satisfied with fifty courtiers
instead of a hundred. At this suggestion,
Lear gets into a strange and unnatural rage,
and asks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either his notion weakens, his discernings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are lethargied. Ha! 'tis not so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is it that can tell me who I am?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so forth.</p>

<p>While this goes on the fool does not cease to
interpolate his humorless jokes. Goneril's
husband then enters and wishes to appease
Lear, but Lear curses Goneril, invoking for
her either sterility or the birth of such an infant-monster
as would return laughter and
contempt for her motherly cares, and would
thus show her all the horror and pain caused
by a child's ingratitude.</p>

<p>These words which express a genuine feeling,
might have been touching had they stood alone.
But they are lost among long and high-flown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
speeches, which Lear keeps incessantly uttering
quite inappropriately. He either invokes
"blasts and fogs" upon the head of his daughter,
or desires his curse to "pierce every sense
about her," or else appealing to his own eyes,
says that should they weep, he will pluck them
out and "cast them with the waters that they
lose to temper clay." And so on.</p>

<p>After this, Lear sends Kent, whom he still
fails to recognize, to his other daughter, and
notwithstanding the despair he has just manifested,
he talks with the fool, and elicits his
jokes. The jokes continue to be mirthless
and besides creating an unpleasant feeling,
similar to shame, the usual effect of unsuccessful
witticisms, they are also so drawn out as
to be positively dull. Thus the fool asks the
King whether he can tell why one's nose stands
in the middle of one's face? Lear says he
can not.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Why, to keep one's eyes of either side 's nose,
that what a man can not smell out, he may spy out."</p>

<p>"Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Nor I either; but I can tell why a snail has a
house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to
his daughters and leave his horns without a case."</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Be my horses ready?"</p>

<p>"Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason
why the seven stars are no more than seven is a
pretty reason."</p>

<p>"Because they are not eight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed: thou would'st make a good fool."</p></div>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>After this lengthy scene, a gentleman enters
and announces that the horses are ready. The
fool says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second part of the first scene of the
second act begins by the villain Edmund persuading
his brother, when their father enters,
to pretend that they are fighting with their
swords. Edgar consents, altho it is utterly
incomprehensible why he should do so. The
father finds them fighting. Edgar flies and
Edmund scratches his arm to draw blood and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
persuades his father that Edgar was working
charms for the purpose of killing his father
and had desired Edmund to help him, but that
he, Edmund, had refused and that then Edgar
flew at him and wounded his arm. Gloucester
believes everything, curses Edgar and transfers
all the rights of the elder and legitimate son
to the illegitimate Edmund. The Duke,
hearing of this, also rewards Edmund.</p>

<p>In the second scene, in front of Gloucester's
palace, Lear's new servant, Kent, still unrecognized
by Lear, without any reason, begins to
abuse Oswald, Goneril's steward, calling him,&mdash;"A
knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats;
a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave;&mdash;the
son and heir of a mongrel bitch." And
so on. Then drawing his sword, he demands
that Oswald should fight with him, saying that
he will make a "sop o' the moonshine" of him,&mdash;words
which no commentators can explain.
When he is stopped, he continues to give vent
to the strangest abuse, saying that a tailor made
Oswald, as "a stone-cutter or a painter could
not have made him so ill, tho they had been
but two hours o' the trade!" He further says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that, if only leave be given him, he will "tread
this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the
wall of a jakes with him."</p>

<p>Thus Kent, whom nobody recognizes, altho
both the King and the Duke of Cornwall, as
well as Gloucester who is present, ought to
know him well, continues to brawl, in the
character of Lear's new servant, until he is
taken and put in the stocks.</p>

<p>The third scene takes place on a heath.
Edgar, flying from the persecutions of his father,
hides in a wood and tells the public what kind
of lunatics exist there&mdash;beggars who go about
naked, thrust wooden pricks and pins into their
flesh, scream with wild voices and enforce
charity, and says that he wishes to simulate
such a lunatic in order to save himself from
persecution. Having communicated this to
the public, he retires.</p>

<p>The fourth scene is again before Gloucester's
castle. Enter Lear and the fool. Lear sees
Kent in the stocks, and, still not recognizing
him, is inflamed with rage against those who
dared so to insult his messenger, and calls for
the Duke and Regan. The fool goes on with
his jokes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Lear with difficulty restrains his ire. Enter
the Duke and Regan. Lear complains of
Goneril but Regan justifies her sister. Lear
curses Goneril, and, when Regan tells him he
had better return to her sister, he is indignant
and says: "Ask her forgiveness?" and falls
down on his knees demonstrating how indecent
it would be if he were abjectly to beg food and
clothing as charity from his own daughter,
and he curses Goneril with the strangest curses
and asks who put his servant in the stocks.
Before Regan can answer, Goneril arrives.
Lear becomes yet more exasperated and again
curses Goneril, but when he is told that it was
the Duke himself who ordered the stocks, he
does not say anything, because, at this moment,
Regan tells him that she can not receive him
now and that he had best return to Goneril,
and that in a month's time she herself will
receive him, with, however, not a hundred
but fifty servants. Lear again curses Goneril
and does not want to go to her, continuing to
hope that Regan will accept him with the
whole hundred servants. But Regan says
she will receive him only with twenty-five and
then Lear makes up his mind to go back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Goneril who admits fifty. But when Goneril
says that even twenty-five are too many, Lear
pours forth a long argument about the superfluous
and the needful being relative and says
that if man is not allowed more than he needs,
he is not to be distinguished from a beast.
Lear, or rather the actor who plays Lear's
part, adds that there is no need for a lady's
finery, which does not keep her warm. After
this he flies into a mad fury and says that to
take vengeance on his daughters he will do
something dreadful but that he will not weep,
and so he departs. A storm begins.</p>

<p>Such is the second act, full of unnatural
events, and yet more unnatural speeches, not
flowing from the position of the characters,&mdash;and
finishing with a scene between Lear and his
daughters which might have been powerful if
it had not been permeated with the most
absurdly foolish, unnatural speeches&mdash;which,
moreover, have no relation to the subject,&mdash;put
into the mouth of Lear. Lear's vacillations
between pride, anger, and the hope of his
daughters' giving in, would be exceedingly
touching if it were not spoilt by the verbose
absurdities to which he gives vent, about being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
ready to divorce himself from Regan's dead
mother, should Regan not be glad to receive
him,&mdash;or about his calling down "fen suck'd
frogs" which he invokes, upon the head of his
daughter, or about the heavens being obliged
to patronize old people because they themselves
are old.</p>

<p>The third act begins with thunder, lightning,
a storm of some special kind such as,
according to the words of the characters in the
piece, had never before taken place. On the
heath, a gentleman tells Kent that Lear, banished
by his daughters from their homes, is
running about the heath alone, tearing his hair
and throwing it to the wind, and that none but
the fool is with him. In return Kent tells the
gentleman that the dukes have quarrelled,
and that the French army has landed at Dover,
and, having communicated this intelligence, he
dispatches the gentleman to Dover to meet
Cordelia.</p>

<p>The second scene of the third act also
takes place on the heath, but in another part
of it. Lear walks about the heath and says
words which are meant to express his despair:
he desires that the winds should blow so hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that they should crack their cheeks and that
the rain should flood everything, that lightning
should singe his white head, and the thunder
flatten the world and destroy all germens "that
make ungrateful man!" The fool keeps uttering
still more senseless words. Enter Kent.
Lear says that for some reason during this storm
all criminals shall be found out and convicted.
Kent, still unrecognized by Lear, endeavors
to persuade him to take refuge in a hovel. At
this point the fool pronounces a prophecy in no
wise related to the situation and they all depart.</p>

<p>The third scene is again transferred to
Gloucester's castle. Gloucester tells Edmund
that the French King has already landed with
his troops, and intends to help Lear. Learning
this, Edmund decides to accuse his father of
treason in order that he may get his heritage.</p>

<p>The fourth scene is again on the heath in
front of the hovel. Kent invites Lear into the
hovel, but Lear answers that he has no reason
to shelter himself from the tempest, that he
does not feel it, having a tempest in his mind,
called forth by the ingratitude of his daughters,
which extinguishes all else. This true feeling,
expressed in simple words, might elicit sym<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>pathy,
but amidst the incessant, pompous raving
it escapes one and loses its significance.</p>

<p>The hovel into which Lear is led, turns out
to be the same which Edgar has entered, disguised
as a madman, <i>i.e.</i>, naked. Edgar comes
out of the hovel, and, altho all have known
him, no one recognizes him,&mdash;as no one recognizes
Kent,&mdash;and Edgar, Lear, and the fool
begin to say senseless things which continue
with interruptions for many pages. In the
middle of this scene, enter Gloucester, who also
does not recognize either Kent or his son Edgar,
and tells them how his son Edgar wanted to
kill him.</p>

<p>This scene is again cut short by another in
Gloucester's castle, during which Edmund
betrays his father and the Duke promises to
avenge himself on Gloucester. Then the scene
shifts back to Lear. Kent, Edgar, Gloucester,
Lear, and the fool are at a farm and talking.
Edgar says: "Frateretto calls me, and tells me
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness...."
The fool says: "Tell me whether a madman
be a gentleman or a yeoman?" Lear, having
lost his mind, says that the madman is a king.
The fool says no, the madman is the yeoman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
who has allowed his son to become a gentleman.
Lear screams: "To have a thousand with red
burning spirits. Come hissing in upon 'em,"&mdash;while
Edgar shrieks that the foul fiend bites
his back. At this the fool remarks that one
can not believe "in the tameness of a wolf, a
horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath."
Then Lear imagines he is judging his daughters.
"Sit thou here, most learned justicer," says he,
addressing the naked Edgar; "Thou, sapient
sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes." To this
Edgar says: "Look where he stands and
glares! Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?"
"Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,&mdash;&mdash;"
while the fool sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her boat hath a leak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she must not speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why she dares not come over to thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Edgar goes on in his own strain. Kent suggests
that Lear should lie down, but Lear continues
his imaginary trial: "Bring in their
evidence," he cries. "Thou robed man of
justice, take thy place," he says to Edgar,
"and thou" (to the fool) "his yoke-fellow of
equity, bench by his side. You are o' the
commission, sit you too," addressing Kent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Purr, the cat is gray," shouts Edgar.</p>

<p>"Arraign her first, 'tis Goneril," cries Lear.
"I here take my oath before this honorable
assembly, she kicked the poor king, her father."</p>

<p>"Come hither, mistress. Is your name
Goneril?" says the fool, addressing the seat.</p>

<p>"And here's another," cries Lear. "Stop
her there! arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption
in the place! False justice, why hast thou
let her 'scape?"</p>

<p>This raving terminates by Lear falling
asleep and Gloucester persuading Kent, still
without recognizing him, to carry Lear to
Dover, and Kent and the fool carry off the King.</p>

<p>The scene is transferred to Gloucester's
castle. Gloucester himself is about to be
accused of treason. He is brought forward
and bound. The Duke of Cornwall plucks
out one of his eyes and sets his foot on it.
Regan says, "One side will mock another;
the other too." The Duke wishes to pluck
the other out also, but some servant, for some
reason, suddenly takes Gloucester's part and
wounds the Duke. Regan kills the servant,
who, dying, says to Gloucester that he has
"one eye left to see some mischief on him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The Duke says, "Lest it see more, prevent it,"
and he tears out Gloucester's other eye and
throws it on the ground. Here Regan says
that it was Edmund who betrayed his father
and then Gloucester immediately understands
that he has been deceived and that Edgar
did not wish to kill him.</p>

<p>Thus ends the third act.</p>

<p>The fourth act is again on the heath.
Edgar, still attired as a lunatic, soliloquizes
in stilted terms about the instability of fortune
and the advantages of a humble lot. Then
there comes to him somehow into the very
place on the heath where he is, his father, the
blinded Gloucester, led by an old man. In
that characteristic Shakespearean language,&mdash;the
chief peculiarity of which is that the
thoughts are bred either by the consonance or
the contrasts of words,&mdash;Gloucester also speaks
about the instability of fortune. He tells the
old man who leads him to leave him, but the
old man points out to him that he can not <i>see</i>
his way. Gloucester says he has no way and
therefore does not require <i>eyes</i>. And he argues
about his having stumbled when he <i>saw</i>, and
about defects often proving commodities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
"Ah! dear son Edgar," he adds, "might I but
live to <i>see</i> thee in my touch, I'd say I had <i>eyes</i>
again." Edgar naked, and in the character
of a lunatic, hearing this, still does not disclose
himself to his father. He takes the place of
the aged guide and talks with his father, who
does not recognize his voice, but regards him
as a wandering madman. Gloucester avails
himself of the opportunity to deliver himself
of a witticism: "'Tis the times' plague when
madmen lead the blind," and he insists on
dismissing the old man, obviously not from
motives which might be natural to Gloucester
at that moment, but merely in order, when left
alone with Edgar, to enact the later scene of
the imaginary leaping from the cliff.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Edgar has just seen his
blinded father, and has learnt that his father
repents of having banished him, he puts in
utterly unnecessary interjections which Shakespeare
might know, having read them in Haronet's
book, but which Edgar had no means
of becoming acquainted with, and above all,
which it was quite unnatural for him to repeat
in his present position. He says, "Five friends
have been in poor Tom at once: of lust, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Obidient; Hobbididance, prince of dumbness;
Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet,
of mopping and mowing; who since
possesses chambermaids and waiting women."</p>

<p>Hearing these words, Gloucester makes a
present of his purse to Edgar, saying:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"That I am so wretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes thee the happier; heavens, deal so still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That slaves your ordinance, that will not see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So distribution should undo excess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each man have enough."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Having pronounced these strange words,
the blind Gloucester requests Edgar to lead
him to a certain cliff overhanging the sea, and
they depart.</p>

<p>The second scene of the fourth act takes
place before the Duke of Albany's palace.
Goneril is not only cruel, but also depraved.
She despises her husband and discloses her
love to the villain Edmund, who has inherited
the title of his father Gloucester. Edmund
leaves, and a conversation takes place between
Goneril and her husband. The Duke of
Albany, the only figure with human feelings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
who had already previously been dissatisfied
with his wife's treatment of her father, now
resolutely takes Lear's side, but expresses his
emotion in such words as to shake one's confidence
in his feeling. He says that a bear
would lick Lear's reverence, that if the heavens
do not send their visible spirits to tame these
vile offenses, humanity must prey on itself
like monsters, etc.</p>

<p>Goneril does not listen to him, and then he
begins to abuse her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See thyself, devil!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proper deformity seems not in the fiend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So horrid as in woman."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"O vain fool," says Goneril. "Thou changed
and self-cover'd thing, for shame," continues
the Duke:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let these hands obey my blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy flesh and bones; howe'er thou art a fiend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman's shape doth shield thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After this a messenger enters, and announces
that the Duke of Cornwall, wounded by his
servant whilst plucking out Gloucester's eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had died. Goneril is glad but already anticipates
with fear that Regan, now a widow, will
deprive her of Edmund. Here the second
scene ends.</p>

<p>The third scene of the fourth act represents
the French camp. From a conversation between
Kent and a gentleman, the reader or
spectator learns that the King of France is not
in the camp and that Cordelia has received
a letter from Kent and is greatly grieved by
what she has learned about her father. The
gentleman says that her face reminded one of
sunshine and rain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">"Her smiles and tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were like a better day; those happy smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As pearls from diamonds dropp'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so forth.</p>

<p>The gentleman says that Cordelia desires
to see her father, but Kent says that Lear is
ashamed of seeing this daughter whom he has
treated so unkindly.</p>

<p>In the fourth scene, Cordelia, talking with
a physician, tells him that Lear has been seen,
that he is quite mad, wearing on his head a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
wreath of various weeds, that he is roaming
about and that she has sent soldiers in search
of him, adding that she desires all secret remedies
to spring with her tears, and the like.</p>

<p>She is informed that the forces of the Dukes
are approaching, but she is concerned only
about her father and departs.</p>

<p>The fifth scene of the fourth act lies in
Gloucester's castle. Regan is talking with
Oswald, Goneril's steward, who is carrying a
letter from Goneril to Edmund, and she announces
to him that she also loves Edmund
and that, being a widow, it is better for her to
marry him than for Goneril to do so, and she
begs him to persuade her sister of this. Further
she tells him that it was very unreasonable to
blind Gloucester and yet leave him alive, and
therefore advises Oswald, should he meet
Gloucester, to kill him, promising him a great
reward if he does this.</p>

<p>In the sixth scene, Gloucester again appears
with his still unrecognized son Edgar, who
(now in the guise of a peasant) pretends to
lead his father to the cliff. Gloucester is walking
along on level land but Edgar persuades
him that they are with difficulty ascending a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
steep hill. Gloucester believes this. Edgar
tells his father that the noise of the sea is heard;
Gloucester believes this also. Edgar stops on
a level place and persuades his father that he
has ascended the cliff and that in front of him
lies a dreadful abyss, and leaves him alone.
Gloucester, addressing the gods, says that he
shakes off his affliction as he can bear it no
longer, and that he does not condemn them&mdash;the
gods. Having said this, he leaps on the
level ground and falls, imagining that he has
jumped off the cliff. On this occasion, Edgar,
soliloquizing, gives vent to a yet more entangled
utterance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know not how conceit may rob<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treasury of life when life itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yields to the theft; had he been where he thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this had thought been past."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He approaches Gloucester, in the character of
yet a different person, and expressing astonishment
at the latter not being hurt by his fall
from such a dreadful height. Gloucester believes
that he has fallen and prepares to die,
but he feels that he is alive and begins to doubt
that he has fallen from such a height. Then
Edgar persuades him that he has indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
jumped from the dreadful height and tells him
that the individual who had been with him at
the top was the devil, as he had eyes like two
full moons and a thousand noses and wavy
horns. Gloucester believes this, and is persuaded
that his despair was the work of the
devil, and therefore decides that he will henceforth
despair no more, but will quietly await
death. Hereupon enters Lear, for some reason
covered with wild-flowers. He has lost his
senses and says things wilder than before.
He speaks about coining, about the moon,
gives some one a yard&mdash;then he cries that he
sees a mouse, which he wishes to entice by a
piece of cheese. Then he suddenly demands
the password from Edgar, and Edgar immediately
answers him with the words "Sweet
marjoram." Lear says, "Pass," and the blind
Gloucester, who has not recognized either his
son or Kent, recognizes the King's voice.</p>

<p>Then the King, after his disconnected utterances,
suddenly begins to speak ironically
about flatterers, who agreed to all he said,
"Ay, and no, too, was no good divinity," but,
when he got into a storm without shelter, he
saw all this was not true; and then goes on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
say that as all creation addicts itself to adultery,
and Gloucester's bastard son had treated his
father more kindly than his daughters had
treated him (altho Lear, according to the
development of the drama, could not know how
Edmund had treated Gloucester), therefore,
let dissoluteness prosper, the more so as, being a
King, he needs soldiers. He here addresses
an imaginary hypocritically virtuous lady who
acts the prude, whereas</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a more riotous appetite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All women inherit the gods only to the girdle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath is all the fiend's"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and, saying this, Lear screams and spits from
horror. This monolog is evidently meant
to be addressed by the actor to the audience,
and probably produces an effect on the stage,
but it is utterly uncalled for in the mouth of
Lear, equally with his words: "It smells of
mortality," uttered while wiping his hand, as
Gloucester expresses a desire to kiss it. Then
Gloucester's blindness is referred to, which
gives occasion for a play of words on <i>eyes</i>,
about blind Cupid, at which Lear says to
Gloucester, "No <i>eyes</i> in your head, nor no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
money in your <i>purse</i>? Your <i>eyes</i> are in a
<i>heavy</i> case, your purse in a <i>light</i>." Then
Lear declaims a monolog on the unfairness of
legal judgment, which is quite out of place in
the mouth of the insane Lear. After this,
enter a gentleman with attendants sent by
Cordelia to fetch her father. Lear continues
to act as a madman and runs away. The gentleman
sent to fetch Lear, does not run after
him, but lengthily describes to Edgar the
position of the French and British armies.
Oswald enters, and seeing Gloucester, and
desiring to receive the reward promised by
Regan, attacks him, but Edgar with his club
kills Oswald, who, in dying, transmits to his
murderer, Edgar, Goneril's letter to Edmund,
the delivery of which would insure reward.
In this letter Goneril promises to kill her
husband and marry Edmund. Edgar drags
out Oswald's body by the legs and then returns
and leads his father away.</p>

<p>The seventh scene of the fourth act takes
place in a tent in the French camp. Lear is
asleep on a bed. Enter Cordelia and Kent,
still in disguise. Lear is awakened by the
music, and, seeing Cordelia, does not believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
she is a living being, thinks she is an apparition,
does not believe that he himself is alive.
Cordelia assures him that she is his daughter,
and begs him to bless her. He falls on his
knees before her, begs her pardon, acknowledges
that he is as old and foolish, says he is
ready to take poison, which he thinks she has
probably prepared for him, as he is persuaded
she must hate him. ("For your sisters," he
says, "have done me wrong: you have some
cause, they have not.") Then he gradually
comes to his senses and ceases to rave. His
daughter suggests that he should take a walk.
He consents and says: "You must bear with
me. Pray you now forget and forgive: I am
old and foolish." They depart. The gentleman
and Kent, remaining on the scene, hold
a conversation which explains to the spectator
that Edmund is at the head of the troops and
that a battle must soon begin between Lear's
defenders and his enemies. So the fourth
act closes.</p>

<p>In this fourth act, the scene between Lear
and his daughter might have been touching
if it had not been preceded in the course of the
earlier acts by the tediously drawn out, monot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>onous
ravings of Lear, and if, moreover, this
expression of his feelings constituted the last
scene. But the scene is not the last.</p>

<p>In the fifth act, the former coldly pompous,
artificial ravings of Lear go on again,
destroying the impression which the previous
scene might have produced.</p>

<p>The first scene of the fifth act at first
represents Edmund and Regan; the latter is
jealous of her sister and makes an offer. Then
come Goneril, her husband, and some soldiers.
The Duke of Albany, altho pitying Lear,
regards it as his duty to fight with the French
who have invaded his country, and so he prepares
for battle.</p>

<p>Then Edgar enters, still disguised, and hands
to the Duke of Albany the letter he had received
from Goneril's dying steward, and tells him
if he gains the victory to sound the trumpet,
saying that he can produce a champion who
will confirm the contents of the letter.</p>

<p>In the second scene, Edgar enters leading
his father Gloucester, seats him by a tree, and
goes away himself. The noise of battle
is heard, Edgar runs back and says that the
battle is lost and Lear and Cordelia are pris<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>oners.
Gloucester again falls into despair.
Edgar, still without disclosing himself to his
father, counsels endurance, and Gloucester
immediately agrees with him.</p>

<p>The third scene opens with a triumphal
progress of the victor Edmund. Lear and
Cordelia are prisoners. Lear, altho no longer
insane, continues to utter the same senseless,
inappropriate words, as, for example, that in
prison he will sing with Cordelia, she will ask
his blessing, and he will kneel down (this
process of kneeling down is repeated three
times) and will ask her forgiveness. And he
further says that, while they are living in prison,
they will wear out "packs and sects of great
ones"; that he and Cordelia are sacrifices upon
which the gods will throw incense, and that he
that parts them "shall bring a brand from
heaven and fire them like foxes; that he will
not weep, and that the plague shall sooner
devour his eyes, flesh and fell, than they shall
make them weep."</p>

<p>Edmund orders Lear and his daughter to
be led away to prison, and, having called the
officer to do this, says he requires another
duty and asks him whether he'll do it? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
captain says he can not draw a cart nor eat
dried oats, but if it be men's work he can do
it. Enter the Duke of Albany, Goneril, and
Regan. The Duke of Albany wishes to champion
Lear, but Edmund does not allow it.
The daughters take part in the dialog and
begin to abuse each other, being jealous of
Edmund. Here everything becomes so confused
that it is difficult to follow the action.
The Duke of Albany wishes to arrest Edmund,
and tells Regan that Edmund has long ago
entered into guilty relations with his wife, and
that, therefore, Regan must give up her claims
on Edmund, and if she wishes to marry, should
marry him, the Duke of Albany.</p>

<p>Having said this, the Duke of Albany calls
Edmund, orders the trumpet to be sounded,
saying that, if no one appears, he will fight him
himself.</p>

<p>Here Regan, whom Goneril has evidently
poisoned, falls deadly sick. Trumpets are
sounded and Edgar enters with a vizor concealing
his face, and, without giving his name,
challenges Edmund. Edgar abuses Edmund;
Edmund throws all the abuses back on Edgar's
head. They fight and Edmund falls. Goneril<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
is in despair. The Duke of Albany shows Goneril
her letter. Goneril departs.</p>

<p>The dying Edmund discovers that his opponent
was his brother. Edgar raises his vizor
and pronounces a moral lesson to the effect
that, having begotten his illegitimate son
Edmund, the father has paid for it with his
eyesight. After this Edgar tells the Duke of
Albany his adventures and how he has only
just now, before entering on the recent combat,
disclosed everything to his father, and the
father could not bear it and died from emotion.
Edmund is not yet dead, and wants to know
all that has taken place.</p>

<p>Then Edgar relates that, while he was sitting
over his father's body, a man came and
closely embraced him, and, shouting as loudly
as if he wished to burst heaven, threw himself
on the body of Edgar's father, and told the
most piteous tale about Lear and himself, and
that while relating this the strings of life
began to crack, but at this moment the trumpet
sounded twice and Edgar left him "tranced"&mdash;and
this was Kent.</p>

<p>Edgar has hardly finished this narrative
when a gentleman rushes in with a bloody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
knife, shouting "Help!" In answer to the
question, "Who is killed?" the gentleman
says that Goneril has been killed, having
poisoned her sister, she has confessed it.</p>

<p>Enters Kent, and at this moment the corpses
of Goneril and Regan are brought in. Edmund
here says that the sisters evidently loved
him, as one has poisoned the other for his
sake, and then slain herself. At the same time
he confesses that he had given orders to kill
Lear and to hang Cordelia in prison, and
pretend that she had taken her own life; but
now he wishes to prevent these deeds, and
having said this he dies, and is carried away.</p>

<p>After this enters Lear with the dead Cordelia
in his arms, altho he is more than eighty years
old and ill. Again begins Lear's awful ravings,
at which one feels ashamed as at unsuccessful
jokes. Lear demands that all should
howl, and, alternately, believes that Cordelia
is dead and that she is alive.</p>

<p>"Had I your tongues and eyes," he says
"I'd use them so that heaven's vault should
crack."</p>

<p>Then he says that he killed the slave who
hanged Cordelia. Next he says that his eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
see badly, but at the same time he recognizes
Kent whom all along he had not recognized.</p>

<p>The Duke of Albany says that he will resign
during the life of Lear and that he will reward
Edgar and Kent and all who have been faithful
to him. At this moment the news is brought
that Edmund is dead, and Lear, continuing his
ravings, begs that they will undo one of his
buttons&mdash;the same request which he had made
when roaming about the heath. He expresses
his thanks for this, tells everyone to look at
something, and thereupon dies.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Duke of Albany, having
survived the others, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The weight of this sad time we must obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oldest hath borne most: we that are young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall never see so much, nor live so long."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All depart to the music of a dead march.
Thus ends the fifth act and the drama.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2>III</h2>

<p>Such is this celebrated drama. However
absurd it may appear in my rendering (which
I have endeavored to make as impartial as
possible), I may confidently say that in the
original it is yet more absurd. For any man
of our time&mdash;if he were not under the hypnotic
suggestion that this drama is the height of
perfection&mdash;it would be enough to read it to
its end (were he to have sufficient patience for
this) to be convinced that far from being the
height of perfection, it is a very bad, carelessly
composed production, which, if it could have
been of interest to a certain public at a certain
time, can not evoke among us anything but
aversion and weariness. Every reader of our
time, who is free from the influence of suggestion,
will also receive exactly the same
impression from all the other extolled dramas
of Shakespeare, not to mention the senseless,
dramatized tales, "Pericles," "Twelfth Night,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"The Tempest," "Cymbeline," "Troilus and
Cressida."</p>

<p>But such free-minded individuals, not inoculated
with Shakespeare-worship, are no longer
to be found in our Christian society. Every
man of our society and time, from the first
period of his conscious life, has been inoculated
with the idea that Shakespeare is a genius, a
poet, and a dramatist, and that all his writings
are the height of perfection. Yet, however
hopeless it may seem, I will endeavor to demonstrate
in the selected drama&mdash;"King Lear"&mdash;all
those faults equally characteristic also of
all the other tragedies and comedies of Shakespeare,
on account of which he not only is not
representing a model of dramatic art, but does
not satisfy the most elementary demands of
art recognized by all.</p>

<p>Dramatic art, according to the laws established
by those very critics who extol Shakespeare,
demands that the persons represented
in the play should be, in consequence of actions
proper to their characters, and owing to a
natural course of events, placed in positions
requiring them to struggle with the surrounding
world to which they find themselves in oppo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>sition,
and in this struggle should display their
inherent qualities.</p>

<p>In "King Lear" the persons represented
are indeed placed externally in opposition to
the outward world, and they struggle with it.
But their strife does not flow from the natural
course of events nor from their own characters,
but is quite arbitrarily established by the
author, and therefore can not produce on the
reader the illusion which represents the essential
condition of art.</p>

<p>Lear has no necessity or motive for his
abdication; also, having lived all his life with
his daughters, has no reason to believe the
words of the two elders and not the truthful
statement of the youngest; yet upon this is
built the whole tragedy of his position.</p>

<p>Similarly unnatural is the subordinate action:
the relation of Gloucester to his sons. The
positions of Gloucester and Edgar flow from
the circumstance that Gloucester, just like
Lear, immediately believes the coarsest untruth
and does not even endeavor to inquire
of his injured son whether what he is accused
of be true, but at once curses and banishes him.
The fact that Lear's relations with his daugh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>ters
are the same as those of Gloucester to his
sons makes one feel yet more strongly that in
both cases the relations are quite arbitrary,
and do not flow from the characters nor the
natural course of events. Equally unnatural,
and obviously invented, is the fact that all
through the tragedy Lear does not recognize
his old courtier, Kent, and therefore the relations
between Lear and Kent fail to excite
the sympathy of the reader or spectator. The
same, in a yet greater degree, holds true of the
position of Edgar, who, unrecognized by any
one, leads his blind father and persuades him
that he has leapt off a cliff, when in reality
Gloucester jumps on level ground.</p>

<p>These positions, into which the characters
are placed quite arbitrarily, are so unnatural
that the reader or spectator is unable not only
to sympathize with their sufferings but even
to be interested in what he reads or sees.
This in the first place.</p>

<p>Secondly, in this, as in the other dramas of
Shakespeare, all the characters live, think,
speak, and act quite unconformably with the
given time and place. The action of "King
Lear" takes place 800 years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and yet the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
characters are placed in conditions possible
only in the Middle Ages: participating in the
drama are kings, dukes, armies, and illegitimate
children, and gentlemen, courtiers, doctors,
farmers, officers, soldiers, and knights
with vizors, etc. It is possible that such anachronisms
(with which Shakespeare's dramas
abound) did not injure the possibility of
illusion in the sixteenth century and the beginning
of the seventeenth, but in our time it is
no longer possible to follow with interest the
development of events which one knows could
not take place in the conditions which the author
describes in detail. The artificiality of
the positions, not flowing from the natural
course of events, or from the nature of the
characters, and their want of conformity with
time and space, is further increased by those
coarse embellishments which are continually
added by Shakespeare and intended to appear
particularly touching. The extraordinary
storm during which King Lear roams about
the heath, or the grass which for some reason
he puts on his head&mdash;like Ophelia in "Hamlet"&mdash;or
Edgar's attire, or the fool's speeches, or the
appearance of the helmeted horseman, Edgar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&mdash;all
these effects not only fail to enhance the
impression, but produce an opposite effect.
"Man sieht die Absicht und man wird verstimmt,"
as Goethe says. It often happens
that even during these obviously intentional
efforts after effect, as, for instance, the dragging
out by the legs of half a dozen corpses, with
which all Shakespeare's tragedies terminate,
instead of feeling fear and pity, one is tempted
rather to laugh.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<h2>IV</h2>

<p>But it is not enough that Shakespeare's
characters are placed in tragic positions which
are impossible, do not flow from the course of
events, are inappropriate to time and space&mdash;these
personages, besides this, act in a way
which is out of keeping with their definite
character, and is quite arbitrary. It is generally
asserted that in Shakespeare's dramas
the characters are specially well expressed,
that, notwithstanding their vividness, they are
many-sided, like those of living people; that,
while exhibiting the characteristics of a given
individual, they at the same time wear the
features of man in general; it is usual to say that
the delineation of character in Shakespeare
is the height of perfection.</p>

<p>This is asserted with such confidence and
repeated by all as indisputable truth; but
however much I endeavored to find confirmation
of this in Shakespeare's dramas, I always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
found the opposite. In reading any of Shakespeare's
dramas whatever, I was, from the very
first, instantly convinced that he was lacking
in the most important, if not the only, means
of portraying characters: individuality of language,
<i>i.e.</i>, the style of speech of every person
being natural to his character. This is absent
from Shakespeare. All his characters speak,
not their own, but always one and the same
Shakespearian, pretentious, and unnatural language,
in which not only they could not speak,
but in which no living man ever has spoken
or does speak.</p>

<p>No living men could or can say, as Lear
says, that he would divorce his wife in the
grave should Regan not receive him, or that the
heavens would crack with shouting, or that the
winds would burst, or that the wind wishes to
blow the land into the sea, or that the curled
waters wish to flood the shore, as the gentleman
describes the storm, or that it is easier to bear
one's grief and the soul leaps over many sufferings
when grief finds fellowship, or that Lear
has become childless while I am fatherless,
as Edgar says, or use similar unnatural expressions
with which the speeches of all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
characters in all Shakespeare's dramas overflow.</p>

<p>Again, it is not enough that all the characters
speak in a way in which no living men ever
did or could speak&mdash;they all suffer from a
common intemperance of language. Those
who are in love, who are preparing for death,
who are fighting, who are dying, all alike speak
much and unexpectedly about subjects utterly
inappropriate to the occasion, being evidently
guided rather by consonances and play of
words than by thoughts. They speak all
alike. Lear raves exactly as does Edgar when
feigning madness. Both Kent and the fool
speak alike. The words of one of the personages
might be placed in the mouth of another,
and by the character of the speech it would be
impossible to distinguish who speaks. If
there is a difference in the speech of Shakespeare's
various characters, it lies merely in
the different dialogs which are pronounced
for these characters&mdash;again by Shakespeare
and not by themselves. Thus Shakespeare
always speaks for kings in one and the same
inflated, empty language. Also in one and the
same Shakespearian, artificially sentimental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
language speak all the women who are intended
to be poetic: Juliet, Desdemona, Cordelia,
Imogen, Marina. In the same way, also, it is
Shakespeare alone who speaks for his villains:
Richard, Edmund, Iago, Macbeth, expressing
for them those vicious feelings which villains
never express. Yet more similar are the
speeches of the madmen with their horrible
words, and those of fools with their mirthless
puns. So that in Shakespeare there is no language
of living individuals&mdash;that language
which in the drama is the chief means of setting
forth character. If gesticulation be also a
means of expressing character, as in ballets,
this is only a secondary means. Moreover,
if the characters speak at random and in a random
way, and all in one and the same diction,
as is the case in Shakespeare's work, then even
the action of gesticulation is wasted. Therefore,
whatever the blind panegyrists of Shakespeare
may say, in Shakespeare there is no
expression of character. Those personages
who, in his dramas, stand out as characters,
are characters borrowed by him from former
works which have served as the foundation
of his dramas, and they are mostly depicted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
not by the dramatic method which consists
in making each person speak with his own
diction, but in the epic method of one person
describing the features of another.</p>

<p>The perfection with which Shakespeare
expresses character is asserted chiefly on the
ground of the characters of Lear, Cordelia,
Othello, Desdemona, Falstaff, and Hamlet.
But all these characters, as well as all the others,
instead of belonging to Shakespeare, are
taken by him from dramas, chronicles, and
romances anterior to him. All these characters
not only are not rendered more powerful
by him, but, in most cases, they are weakened
and spoilt. This is very striking in this drama
of "King Lear," which we are examining,
taken by him from the drama "King Leir,"
by an unknown author. The characters of
this drama, that of King Lear, and especially
of Cordelia, not only were not created by
Shakespeare, but have been strikingly weakened
and deprived of force by him, as compared
with their appearance in the older drama.</p>

<p>In the older drama, Leir abdicates because,
having become a widower, he thinks only of
saving his soul. He asks his daughters as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
their love for him&mdash;that, by means of a certain
device he has invented, he may retain
his favorite daughter on his island. The
elder daughters are betrothed, while the
youngest does not wish to contract a loveless
union with any of the neighboring suitors
whom Leir proposes to her, and he is afraid
that she may marry some distant potentate.</p>

<p>The device which he has invented, as he
informs his courtier, Perillus (Shakespeare's
Kent), is this, that when Cordelia tells him
that she loves him more than any one or as
much as her elder sisters do, he will tell her
that she must, in proof of her love, marry the
prince he will indicate on his island. All
these motives for Lear's conduct are absent
in Shakespeare's play. Then, when, according
to the old drama, Leir asks his daughters
about their love for him, Cordelia does not say,
as Shakespeare has it, that she will not give
her father all her love, but will love her husband,
too, should she marry&mdash;which is quite
unnatural&mdash;but simply says that she can not
express her love in words, but hopes that her
actions will prove it. Goneril and Regan
remark that Cordelia's answer is not an an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>swer,
and that the father can not meekly accept
such indifference, so that what is wanting in
Shakespeare&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the explanation of Lear's
anger which caused him to disinherit his youngest
daughter,&mdash;exists in the old drama. Leir
is annoyed by the failure of his scheme, and
the poisonous words of his eldest daughters
irritate him still more. After the division of
the kingdom between the elder daughters,
there follows in the older drama a scene between
Cordelia and the King of Gaul, setting
forth, instead of the colorless Cordelia of
Shakespeare, a very definite and attractive
character of the truthful, tender, and self-sacrificing
youngest daughter. While Cordelia,
without grieving that she has been deprived
of a portion of the heritage, sits sorrowing at
having lost her father's love, and looking
forward to earn her bread by her labor, there
comes the King of Gaul, who, in the disguise
of a pilgrim, desires to choose a bride from
among Leir's daughters. He asks Cordelia
why she is sad. She tells him the cause of her
grief. The King of Gaul, still in the guise of
a pilgrim, falls in love with her, and offers to
arrange a marriage for her with the King of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Gaul, but she says she will marry only a man
whom she loves. Then the pilgrim, still disguised,
offers her his hand and heart and
Cordelia confesses she loves the pilgrim and
consents to marry him, notwithstanding the
poverty that awaits her. Then the pilgrim
discloses to her that he it is who is the King of
Gaul, and Cordelia marries him. Instead of
this scene, Lear, according to Shakespeare,
offers Cordelia's two suitors to take her without
dowry, and one cynically refuses, while the
other, one does not know why, accepts her.
After this, in the old drama, as in Shakespeare's,
Leir undergoes the insults of Goneril,
into whose house he has removed, but he bears
these insults in a very different way from that
represented by Shakespeare: he feels that by
his conduct toward Cordelia, he has deserved
this, and humbly submits. As in Shakespeare's
drama, so also in the older drama, the
courtiers, Perillus&mdash;Kent&mdash;who had interceded
for Cordelia and was therefore banished&mdash;comes
to Leir and assures him of his love,
but under no disguise, but simply as a faithful
old servant who does not abandon his king
in a moment of need. Leir tells him what,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
according to Shakespeare, he tells Cordelia in
the last scene, that, if the daughters whom
he has benefited hate him, a retainer to whom
he has done no good can not love him. But
Perillus&mdash;Kent&mdash;assures the King of his love
toward him, and Leir, pacified, goes on to
Regan. In the older drama there are no
tempests nor tearing out of gray hairs, but there
is the weakened and humbled old man, Leir,
overpowered with grief, and banished by his
other daughter also, who even wishes to kill
him. Turned out by his elder daughters,
Leir, according to the older drama, as a last
resource, goes with Perillus to Cordelia. Instead
of the unnatural banishment of Lear
during the tempest, and his roaming about the
heath, Leir, with Perillus, in the older drama,
during their journey to France, very naturally
reach the last degree of destitution, sell
their clothes in order to pay for their crossing
over the sea, and, in the attire of fishermen,
exhausted by cold and hunger, approach
Cordelia's house. Here, again, instead of the
unnatural combined ravings of the fool, Lear,
and Edgar, as represented by Shakespeare,
there follows in the older drama a natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
scene of reunion between the daughter and the
father. Cordelia&mdash;who, notwithstanding her
happiness, has all the time been grieving about
her father and praying to God to forgive her
sisters who had done him so much wrong&mdash;meets
her father in his extreme want, and wishes
immediately to disclose herself to him, but her
husband advises her not to do this, in order
not to agitate her weak father. She accepts
the counsel and takes Leir into her house
without disclosing herself to him, and nurses
him. Leir gradually revives, and then the
daughter asks him who he is and how he lived
formerly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If from the first," says Leir, "I should relate the cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I would make a heart of adamant to weep.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And thou, poor soul, kind-hearted as thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dost weep already, ere I do begin."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cordelia: "For God's love tell it, and when you have done<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll tell the reason why I weep so soon."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Leir relates all he has suffered from his
elder daughters, and says that now he wishes
to find shelter with the child who would be
in the right even were she to condemn him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
death. "If, however," he says, "she will
receive me with love, it will be God's and her
work, but not my merit." To this Cordelia
says: "Oh, I know for certain that thy daughter
will lovingly receive thee."&mdash;"How canst thou
know this without knowing her?" says Leir.
"I know," says Cordelia, "because not far
from here, I had a father who acted toward
me as badly as thou hast acted toward her,
yet, if I were only to see his white head, I would
creep to meet him on my knees."&mdash;"No, this
can not be," says Leir, "for there are no children
in the world so cruel as mine."&mdash;"Do
not condemn all for the sins of some," says
Cordelia, and falls on her knees. "Look here,
dear father," she says, "look on me: I am thy
loving daughter." The father recognizes her
and says: "It is not for thee, but for me, to beg
thy pardon on my knees for all my sins toward
thee."</p>

<p>Is there anything approaching this exquisite
scene in Shakespeare's drama?</p>

<p>However strange this opinion may seem to
worshipers of Shakespeare, yet the whole of
this old drama is incomparably and in every
respect superior to Shakespeare's adaptation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
It is so, first, because it has not got the utterly
superfluous characters of the villain Edmund
and unlifelike Gloucester and Edgar, who
only distract one's attention; secondly because
it has not got the completely false "effects"
of Lear running about the heath, his conversations
with the fool, and all these impossible
disguises, failures to recognize, and accumulated
deaths; and, above all, because in this drama
there is the simple, natural, and deeply touching
character of Leir and the yet more touching
and clearly defined character of Cordelia,
both absent in Shakespeare. Therefore, there
is in the older drama, instead of Shakespeare's
long-drawn scene of Lear's interview with
Cordelia and of Cordelia's unnecessary murder,
the exquisite scene of the interview between
Leir and Cordelia, unequaled by any
in all Shakespeare's dramas.</p>

<p>The old drama also terminates more naturally
and more in accordance with the moral
demands of the spectator than does Shakespeare's,
namely, by the King of the Gauls
conquering the husbands of the elder sisters,
and Cordelia, instead of being killed, restoring
Leir to his former position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus it is in the drama we are examining,
which Shakespeare has borrowed from the
drama "King Leir." So it is also with Othello,
taken from an Italian romance, the same also
with the famous Hamlet. The same with Antony,
Brutus, Cleopatra, Shylock, Richard, and
all Shakespeare's characters, all taken from
some antecedent work. Shakespeare, while
profiting by characters already given in preceding
dramas, or romances, chronicles, or,
Plutarch's "Lives," not only fails to render them
more truthful and vivid, as his eulogists affirm,
but, on the contrary, always weakens them and
often completely destroys them, as with Lear,
compelling his characters to commit actions
unnatural to them, and, above all, to utter
speeches natural neither to them nor to any one
whatever. Thus, in "Othello," altho that is,
perhaps, I will not say the best, but the least
bad and the least encumbered by pompous
volubility, the characters of Othello, Iago,
Cassio, Emilia, according to Shakespeare,
are much less natural and lifelike than in the
Italian romance. Shakespeare's Othello suffers
from epilepsy, of which he has an attack
on the stage; moreover, in Shakespeare's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
version, Desdemona's murder is preceded by
the strange vow of the kneeling Othello.
Othello, according to Shakespeare, is a negro
and not a Moor. All this is erratic, inflated,
unnatural, and violates the unity of the character.
All this is absent in the romance. In
that romance the reasons for Othello's jealousy
are represented more naturally than in Shakespeare.
In the romance, Cassio, knowing whose
the handkerchief is, goes to Desdemona to
return it, but, approaching the back-door of
Desdemona's house, sees Othello and flies
from him. Othello perceives the escaping
Cassio, and this, more than anything, confirms
his suspicions. Shakespeare has not
got this, and yet this casual incident explains
Othello's jealousy more than anything else.
With Shakespeare, this jealousy is founded
entirely on Iago's persistent, successful machinations
and treacherous words, which Othello
blindly believes. Othello's monolog over the
sleeping Desdemona, about his desiring her
when killed to look as she is alive, about his
going to love her even dead, and now wishing
to smell her "balmy breath," etc., is utterly
impossible. A man who is preparing for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
murder of a beloved being, does not utter such
phrases, still less after committing the murder
would he speak about the necessity of an
eclipse of sun and moon, and of the globe
yawning; nor can he, negro tho he may be,
address devils, inviting them to burn him in hot
sulphur and so forth. Lastly, however effective
may be the suicide, absent in the romance,
it completely destroys the conception of his
clearly defined character. If he indeed suffered
from grief and remorse, he would not,
intending to kill himself, pronounce phrases
about his own services, about the pearl, and
about his eyes dropping tears "<i>as fast as the
Arabian trees their medicinal gum</i>"; and yet
less about the Turk's beating an Italian and
how he, Othello, smote him&mdash;<i>thus!</i> So that
notwithstanding the powerful expression of
emotion in Othello when, under the influence
of Iago's hints, jealousy rises in him, and again
in his scenes with Desdemona, one's conception
of Othello's character is constantly infringed
by his false pathos and the unnatural speeches
he pronounces.</p>

<p>So it is with the chief character, Othello,
but notwithstanding its alteration and the dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>advantageous
features which it is made
thereby to present in comparison with the
character from which it was taken in the
romance, this character still remains a character,
but all the other personages are completely
spoiled by Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Iago, according to Shakespeare, is an unmitigated
villain, deceiver, and thief, a robber
who robs Roderigo and always succeeds even
in his most impossible designs, and therefore
is a person quite apart from real life. In
Shakespeare, the motive of his villainy is, first,
that Othello did not give him the post he
desired; secondly, that he suspects Othello of
an intrigue with his wife and, thirdly, that,
as he says, he feels a strange kind of love for
Desdemona. There are many motives, but
they are all vague. Whereas in the romance
there is but one simple and clear motive, Iago's
passionate love for Desdemona, transmitted
into hatred toward her and Othello after she
had preferred the Moor to him and resolutely
repulsed him. Yet more unnatural is the
utterly unnecessary Roderigo whom Iago deceives
and robs, promising him Desdemona's
love, and whom he forces to fulfil all he com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>mands:
to intoxicate Cassio, provoke and
then kill Cassio. Emilia, who says anything
it may occur to the author to put into her
mouth, has not even the slightest semblance
of a live character.</p>

<p>"But Falstaff, the wonderful Falstaff,"
Shakespeare's eulogists will say, "of him, at
all events, one can not say that he is not a
living character, or that, having been taken
from the comedy of an unknown author, it
has been weakened."</p>

<p>Falstaff, like all Shakespeare's characters,
was taken from a drama or comedy by an
unknown author, written on a really living
person, Sir John Oldcastle, who had been the
friend of some duke. This Oldcastle had
once been convicted of heresy, but had been
saved by his friend the duke. But afterward
he was condemned and burned at the stake
for his religious beliefs, which did not conform
with Catholicism. It was on this same Oldcastle
that an anonymous author, in order to
please the Catholic public, wrote a comedy
or drama, ridiculing this martyr for his faith
and representing him as a good-for-nothing
man, the boon companion of the duke, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is from this comedy that Shakespeare borrowed,
not only the character of Falstaff, but also his
own ironical attitude toward it. In Shakespeare's
first works, when this character appeared,
it was frankly called "Oldcastle,"
but later, in Elizabeth's time, when Protestantism
again triumphed, it was awkward to
bring out with mockery a martyr in the strife
with Catholicism, and, besides, Oldcastle's
relatives had protested, and Shakespeare accordingly
altered the name of Oldcastle to
that of Falstaff, also a historical figure, known
for having fled from the field of battle at
Agincourt.</p>

<p>Falstaff is, indeed, quite a natural and typical
character; but then it is perhaps the only
natural and typical character depicted by
Shakespeare. And this character is natural
and typical because, of all Shakespeare's characters,
it alone speaks a language proper to
itself. And it speaks thus because it speaks
in that same Shakespearian language, full of
mirthless jokes and unamusing puns which,
being unnatural to all Shakespeare's other
characters, is quite in harmony with the boastful,
distorted, and depraved character of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
drunken Falstaff. For this reason alone does
this figure truly represent a definite character.
Unfortunately, the artistic effect of this character
is spoilt by the fact that it is so repulsive
by its gluttony, drunkenness, debauchery, rascality,
deceit, and cowardice, that it is difficult
to share the feeling of gay humor with
which the author treats it. Thus it is with
Falstaff.</p>

<p>But in none of Shakespeare's figures is his,
I will not say incapacity to give, but utter
indifference to giving, his personages a typical
character so strikingly manifest as in Hamlet;
and in connection with none of Shakespeare's
works do we see so strikingly displayed
that blind worship of Shakespeare, that unreasoning
state of hypnotism owing to which
the mere thought even is not admitted that
any of Shakespeare's productions can be
wanting in genius, or that any of the principal
personages in his dramas can fail to be the
expression of a new and deeply conceived character.</p>

<p>Shakespeare takes an old story, not bad in
its way, relating:</p>

<p>"Avec quelle ruse Amlette qui depuis fut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Roy de Dannemarch, vengea la mort de son
p&egrave;re Horwendille, occis par Fengon son fr&egrave;re,
et autre occurrence de son histoire," or a
drama which was written on this theme fifteen
years before him. On this subject he writes
his own drama, introducing quite inappropriately
(as indeed he always does) into the
mouth of the principal person all those thoughts
of his own which appeared to him worthy of
attention. And putting into the mouth of his
hero these thoughts: about life (the grave-digger),
about death (To be or not to be)&mdash;the
same which are expressed in his sixty-sixth
sonnet&mdash;about the theater, about women.
He is utterly unconcerned as to the circumstances
under which these words are said, and
it naturally turns out that the person expressing
all these thoughts is a mere phonograph of
Shakespeare, without character, whose actions
and words do not agree.</p>

<p>In the old legend, Hamlet's personality is
quite comprehensible: he is indignant at his
mother's and his uncle's deeds, and wishes
to revenge himself upon them, but is afraid
his uncle may kill him as he had killed
his father. Therefore he simulates insanity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
desiring to bide his time and observe all that
goes on in the palace. Meanwhile, his uncle
and mother, being afraid of him, wish to test
whether he is feigning or is really mad, and
send to him a girl whom he loves. He persists,
then sees his mother in private, kills a courtier
who was eavesdropping, and convicts his mother
of her sin. Afterward he is sent to England,
but intercepts letters and, returning from England,
takes revenge of his enemies, burning
them all.</p>

<p>All this is comprehensible and flows from
Hamlet's character and position. But Shakespeare,
putting into Hamlet's mouth speeches
which he himself wishes to express, and making
him commit actions which are necessary to
the author in order to produce scenic effects,
destroys all that constitutes the character of
Hamlet and of the legend. During the whole
of the drama, Hamlet is doing, not what he
would really wish to do, but what is necessary
for the author's plan. One moment he is awe-struck
at his father's ghost, another moment
he begins to chaff it, calling it "old mole";
one moment he loves Ophelia, another moment
he teases her, and so forth. There is no pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>sibility
of finding any explanation whatever
of Hamlet's actions or words, and therefore
no possibility of attributing any character to
him.</p>

<p>But as it is recognized that Shakespeare the
genius can not write anything bad, therefore
learned people use all the powers of their minds
to find extraordinary beauties in what is an
obvious and crying failure, demonstrated with
especial vividness in "Hamlet," where the principal
figure has no character whatever. And
lo! profound critics declare that in this drama,
in the person of Hamlet, is expressed singularly
powerful, perfectly novel, and deep personality,
existing in this person having no
character; and that precisely in this absence
of character consists the genius of creating a
deeply conceived character. Having decided
this, learned critics write volumes upon volumes,
so that the praise and explanation of
the greatness and importance of the representation
of the character of a man who has no
character form in volume a library. It is
true that some of the critics timidly express
the idea that there is something strange in this
figure, that Hamlet is an unsolved riddle, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
no one has the courage to say (as in Hans
Andersen's story) that the King is naked&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
that it is as clear as day that Shakespeare
did not succeed and did not even wish to give
any character to Hamlet, did not even understand
that this was necessary. And learned
critics continue to investigate and extol this
puzzling production, which reminds one of the
famous stone with an inscription which Pickwick
found near a cottage doorstep, and which
divided the scientific world into two hostile
camps.</p>

<p>So that neither do the characters of Lear nor
Othello nor Falstaff nor yet Hamlet in any
way confirm the existing opinion that Shakespeare's
power consists in the delineation of
character.</p>

<p>If in Shakespeare's dramas one does meet
figures having certain characteristic features,
for the most part secondary figures, such as
Polonius in "Hamlet" and Portia in "The
Merchant of Venice," these few lifelike characters
among five hundred or more other secondary
figures, with the complete absence of
character in the principal figures, do not at
all prove that the merit of Shakespeare's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
dramas consists in the expression of character.</p>

<p>That a great talent for depicting character
is attributed to Shakespeare arises from his
actually possessing a peculiarity which, for
superficial observers and in the play of good
actors, may appear to be the capacity of depicting
character. This peculiarity consists
in the capacity of representative scenes expressing
the play of emotion. However unnatural
the positions may be in which he places
his characters, however improper to them the
language which he makes them speak, however
featureless they are, the very play of emotion,
its increase, and alteration, and the combination
of many contrary feelings, as expressed correctly
and powerfully in some of Shakespeare's
scenes, and in the play of good actors, evokes
even, if only for a time, sympathy with the
persons represented. Shakespeare, himself an
actor, and an intelligent man, knew how to
express by the means not only of speech, but
of exclamation, gesture, and the repetition
of words, states of mind and developments
or changes of feeling taking place in the persons
represented. So that, in many instances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Shakespeare's characters, instead of speaking,
merely make an exclamation, or weep, or in
the middle of a monolog, by means of gestures,
demonstrate the pain of their position (just
as Lear asks some one to unbutton him), or, in
moments of great agitation, repeat a question
several times, or several times demand the
repetition of a word which has particularly
struck them, as do Othello, Macduff, Cleopatra,
and others. Such clever methods of
expressing the development of feeling, giving
good actors the possibility of demonstrating
their powers, were, and are, often mistaken by
many critics for the expression of character.
But however strongly the play of feeling may
be expressed in one scene, a single scene can
not give the character of a figure when this
figure, after a correct exclamation or gesture,
begins in a language not its own, at the author's
arbitrary will, to volubly utter words which
are neither necessary nor in harmony with its
character.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<h2>V</h2>

<p>"Well, but the profound utterances and
sayings expressed by Shakespeare's characters,"
Shakespeare's panegyrists will retort. "See
Lear's monolog on punishment, Kent's speech
about vengeance, or Edgar's about his former
life, Gloucester's reflections on the instability
of fortune, and, in other dramas, the famous
monologs of Hamlet, Antony, and others."</p>

<p>Thoughts and sayings may be appreciated,
I will answer, in a prose work, in an essay, a
collection of aphorisms, but not in an artistic
dramatic production, the object of which is to
elicit sympathy with that which is represented.
Therefore the monologs and sayings of Shakespeare,
even did they contain very many deep
and new thoughts, which they do not, do not
constitute the merits of an artistic, poetic production.
On the contrary, these speeches,
expressed in unnatural conditions, can only
spoil artistic works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>An artistic, poetic work, particularly a drama,
must first of all excite in the reader or spectator
the illusion that whatever the person represented
is living through, or experiencing, is
lived through or experienced by himself. For
this purpose it is as important for the dramatist
to know precisely what he should make
his characters both do and say as what he should
not make them say and do, so as not to destroy
the illusion of the reader or spectator. Speeches,
however eloquent and profound they may be,
when put into the mouth of dramatic characters,
if they be superfluous or unnatural to the
position and character, destroy the chief condition
of dramatic art&mdash;the illusion, owing to
which the reader or spectator lives in the
feelings of the persons represented. Without
putting an end to the illusion, one may leave
much unsaid&mdash;the reader or spectator will
himself fill this up, and sometimes, owing to
this, his illusion is even increased, but to say
what is superfluous is the same as to overthrow
a statue composed of separate pieces and thereby
scatter them, or to take away the lamp
from a magic lantern: the attention of the
reader or spectator is distracted, the reader<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sees the author, the spectator sees the actor,
the illusion disappears, and to restore it is
sometimes impossible; therefore without the
feeling of measure there can not be an artist,
and especially a dramatist.</p>

<p>Shakespeare is devoid of this feeling. His
characters continually do and say what is not
only unnatural to them, but utterly unnecessary.
I do not cite examples of this, because
I believe that he who does not himself see this
striking deficiency in all Shakespeare's dramas
will not be persuaded by any examples and
proofs. It is sufficient to read "King Lear,"
alone, with its insanity, murders, plucking out
of eyes, Gloucester's jump, its poisonings,
and wranglings&mdash;not to mention "Pericles,"
"Cymbeline," "The Winter's Tale," "The
Tempest"&mdash;to be convinced of this. Only a
man devoid of the sense of measure and of taste
could produce such types as "Titus Andronicus"
or "Troilus and Cressida," or so mercilessly
mutilate the old drama "King Leir."</p>

<p>Gervinus endeavors to prove that Shakespeare
possessed the feeling of beauty, "Sch&ouml;nheit's
sinn," but all Gervinus's proofs prove
only that he himself, Gervinus, is completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
destitute of it. In Shakespeare everything is
exaggerated: the actions are exaggerated, so
are their consequences, the speeches of the
characters are exaggerated, and therefore at
every step the possibility of artistic impression
is interfered with. Whatever people may say,
however they may be enraptured by Shakespeare's
works, whatever merits they may attribute
to them, it is perfectly certain that he was
not an artist and that his works are not artistic
productions. Without the sense of measure,
there never was nor can be an artist, as without
the feeling of rhythm there can not be a musician.
Shakespeare might have been whatever
you like, but he was not an artist.</p>

<p>"But one should not forget the time at which
Shakespeare wrote," say his admirers. "It
was a time of cruel and coarse habits, a time
of the then fashionable euphemism, <i>i.e.</i>, artificial
way of expressing oneself&mdash;a time of
forms of life strange to us, and therefore, to
judge about Shakespeare, one should have in
view the time when he wrote. In Homer, as
in Shakespeare, there is much which is strange
to us, but this does not prevent us from appreciating
the beauties of Homer," say these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
admirers. But in comparing Shakespeare with
Homer, as does Gervinus, that infinite distance
which separates true poetry from its semblance
manifests itself with especial force. However
distant Homer is from us, we can, without
the slightest effort, transport ourselves
into the life he describes, and we can thus
transport ourselves because, however alien to
us may be the events Homer describes, he
believes in what he says and speaks seriously,
and therefore he never exaggerates, and the
sense of measure never abandons him. This
is the reason why, not to speak of the wonderfully
distinct, lifelike, and beautiful characters
of Achilles, Hector, Priam, Odysseus, and the
eternally touching scenes of Hector's leave-taking,
of Priam's embassy, of Odysseus's
return, and others&mdash;the whole of the "Iliad"
and still more the "Odyssey" are so humanly
near to us that we feel as if we ourselves had
lived, and are living, among its gods and
heroes. Not so with Shakespeare. From
his first words, exaggeration is seen: the exaggeration
of events, the exaggeration of emotion,
and the exaggeration of effects. One
sees at once that he does not believe in what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he says, that it is of no necessity to him, that
he invents the events he describes, and is indifferent
to his characters&mdash;that he has conceived
them only for the stage and therefore makes
them do and say only what may strike his
public; and therefore we do not believe either
in the events, or in the actions, or in the sufferings
of the characters. Nothing demonstrates
so clearly the complete absence of esthetic
feeling in Shakespeare as comparison between
him and Homer. The works which we call
the works of Homer are artistic, poetic, original
works, lived through by the author or authors;
whereas the works of Shakespeare&mdash;borrowed
as they are, and, externally, like mosaics, artificially
fitted together piecemeal from bits
invented for the occasion&mdash;have nothing whatever
in common with art and poetry.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2>VI</h2>

<p>But, perhaps, the height of Shakespeare's
conception of life is such that, tho he does not
satisfy the esthetic demands, he discloses to us
a view of life so new and important for men that,
in consideration of its importance, all his failures
as an artist become imperceptible. So,
indeed, say Shakespeare's admirers. Gervinus
says distinctly that besides Shakespeare's
significance in the sphere of dramatic poetry
in which, according to his opinion, Shakespeare
equals "Homer in the sphere of Epos, Shakespeare
being the very greatest judge of the
human soul, represents a teacher of most
indisputable ethical authority and the most
select leader in the world and in life."</p>

<p>In what, then, consists this indisputable
authority of the most select leader in the world
and in life? Gervinus devotes the concluding
chapter of his second volume, about fifty
pages, to an explanation of this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The ethical authority of this supreme teacher
of life consists in the following: The starting
point of Shakespeare's conception of life,
says Gervinus, is that man is gifted with powers
of activity, and therefore, first of all, according
to Gervinus, Shakespeare regarded it as good
and necessary for man that he should act
(as if it were possible for a man not to act):</p>

<p>"Die thatkr&auml;ftigen M&auml;nner, Fortinbras,
Bolingbroke, Alcibiades, Octavius spielen hier
die gegens&auml;tzlichen Rollen gegen die verschiedenen
thatlosen; nicht ihre Charaktere verdienen
ihnen Allen ihr Gl&uuml;ck und Gedeihen
etwa durch eine grosse Ueberlegenheit ihrer
Natur, sondern trotz ihrer geringeren Anlage
stellt sich ihre Thatkraft an sich &uuml;ber die
Unth&auml;tigkeit der Anderen hinaus, gleichviel
aus wie sch&ouml;ner Quelle diese Passivit&auml;t, aus wie
schlechter jene Th&auml;tigkeit fliesse."</p>

<p><i>I.e.</i>, active people, like Fortinbras, Bolingbroke,
Alcibiades, Octavius, says Gervinus,
are placed in contrast, by Shakespeare, with
various characters who do not exhibit energetic
activity. And happiness and success, according
to Shakespeare, are attained by individuals
possessing this active character, not at all owing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to the superiority of their nature; on the contrary,
notwithstanding their inferior gifts, the
capacity of activity itself always gives them
the advantage over inactivity, quite independent
of any consideration whether the inactivity
of some persons flows from excellent impulses
and the activity of others from bad ones.
"Activity is good, inactivity is evil. Activity
transforms evil into good," says Shakespeare,
according to Gervinus. Shakespeare prefers
the principle of Alexander (of Macedonia) to
that of Diogenes, says Gervinus. In other
words, he prefers death and murder due to
ambition, to abstinence and wisdom.</p>

<p>According to Gervinus, Shakespeare believes
that humanity need not set up ideals, but that
only healthy activity and the golden mean are
necessary in everything. Indeed, Shakespeare
is so penetrated by this conviction that, according
to Gervinus's assertion, he allows himself
to deny even Christian morality, which makes
exaggerated demands on human nature.
Shakespeare, as we read, did not approve of
limits of duty exceeding the intentions of
nature. He teaches the golden mean between
heathen hatred to one's enemies and Christian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
love toward them (pp. 561, 562). How far
Shakespeare was penetrated with this fundamental
principle of <i>reasonable moderation</i>,
says Gervinus, can be seen from the fact that
he has the courage to express himself even
against the Christian rules which prompt
human nature to the excessive exertion of its
powers. He did not admit that the limits of
duties should exceed the biddings of Nature.
Therefore he preached a reasonable mean natural
to man, between Christian and heathen
precepts, of love toward one's enemies on the
one hand, and hatred toward them on the other.</p>

<p>That one may do too much good (exceed
the reasonable limits of good) is convincingly
proved by Shakespeare's words and examples.
Thus excessive generosity ruins Timon, while
Antonio's moderate generosity confers honor;
normal ambition makes Henry V. great, whereas
it ruins Percy, in whom it has risen too high;
excessive virtue leads Angelo to destruction,
and if, in those who surround him, excessive
severity becomes harmful and can not prevent
crime, on the other hand the divine element
in man, even charity, if it be excessive, can
create crime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Shakespeare taught, says Gervinus, that one
<i>may be too good</i>.</p>

<p>He teaches that morality, like politics, is a
matter in which, owing to the complexity of
circumstances and motives, one can not establish
any principles (p. 563), and in this he agrees
with Bacon and Aristotle&mdash;there are no positive
religious and moral laws which may create
principles for correct moral conduct suitable
for all cases.</p>

<p>Gervinus most clearly expresses the whole of
Shakespeare's moral theory by saying that
Shakespeare does not write for those classes
for whom definite religious principles and laws
are suitable (<i>i.e.</i>, for nine hundred and ninety-nine
one-thousandths of men) but for the educated:</p>

<p>"There are classes of men whose morality
is best guarded by the positive precepts
of religion and state law; to such persons
Shakespeare's creations are inaccessible. They
are comprehensible and accessible only to the
educated, from whom one can expect that they
should acquire the healthy tact of life and self-consciousness
by means of which the innate
guiding powers of conscience and reason, uni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>ting
with the will, lead us to the definite attainment
of worthy aims in life. But even
for such educated people, Shakespeare's teaching
is not always without danger. The condition
on which his teaching is quite harmless
is that it should be accepted in all its completeness,
in all its parts, without any omission.
Then it is not only without danger, but is the
most clear and faultless and therefore the
most worthy of confidence of all moral teaching"
(p. 564).</p>

<p>In order thus to accept all, one should understand
that, according to his teaching, it is
stupid and harmful for the individual to revolt
against, or endeavor to overthrow, the limits
of established religious and state forms.
"Shakespeare," says Gervinus, "would abhor
an independent and free individual who, with
a powerful spirit, should struggle against all
convention in politics and morality and overstep
that union between religion and the State
which has for thousands of years supported
society. According to his views, the practical
wisdom of men could not have a higher object
than the introduction into society of the greatest
spontaneity and freedom, but precisely because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of this one should safeguard as sacred and
irrefragable the natural laws of society&mdash;one
should respect the existing order of things
and, continually verifying it, inculcate its
rational sides, not overlooking nature for the
sake of culture, or <i>vice versa</i>" (p. 566). Property,
the family, the state, are sacred; but
aspiration toward the recognition of the
equality of men is insanity. Its realization
would bring humanity to the greatest calamities.
No one struggled more than Shakespeare
against the privileges of rank and position,
but could this freethinking man resign himself
to the privileges of the wealthy and educated
being destroyed in order to give room
to the poor and ignorant? How could a man
who so eloquently attracts people toward honors,
permit that the very aspiration toward
that which was great be crushed together with
rank and distinction for services, and, with
the destruction of all degrees, "the motives
for all high undertakings be stifled"? Even
if the attraction of honors and false power
treacherously obtained were to cease, could
the poet admit of the most dreadful of all violence,
that of the ignorant crowd? He saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that, thanks to this equality now preached,
everything may pass into violence, and violence
into arbitrary acts and thence into unchecked
passion which will rend the world as the wolf
does its prey, and in the end the world will
swallow itself up. Even if this does not happen
with mankind when it attains equality&mdash;if
the love of nations and eternal peace prove not
to be that impossible "nothing," as Alonso expressed
it in "The Tempest"&mdash;but if, on the
contrary, the actual attainment of aspirations toward
equality is possible, then the poet would
deem that the old age and extinction of the
world had approached, and that, therefore, for
active individuals, it is not worth while to live
(pp. 571, 572).</p>

<p>Such is Shakespeare's view of life as demonstrated
by his greatest exponent and admirer.</p>

<p>Another of the most modern admirers of
Shakespeare, George Brandes, further sets
forth:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"No one, of course, can conserve his life
quite pure from evil, from deceit, and from the
injury of others, but evil and deceit are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
always vices, and even the evil caused to others,
is not necessarily a vice: it is often merely a
necessity, a legitimate weapon, a right. And
indeed, Shakespeare always held that there are
no unconditional prohibitions, nor unconditional
duties. For instance, he did not doubt
Hamlet's right to kill the King, nor even
his right to stab Polonius to death, and yet
he could not restrain himself from an overwhelming
feeling of indignation and repulsion
when, looking around, he saw everywhere how
incessantly the most elementary moral laws
were being infringed. Now, in his mind there
was formed, as it were, a closely riveted ring
of thoughts concerning which he had always
vaguely felt: such unconditional commandments
do not exist; the quality and significance
of an act, not to speak of a character, do not
depend upon their enactment or infringement;
the whole substance lies in the contents with
which the separate individual, at the moment
of his decision and on his own responsibility,
fills up the form of these laws."</p>

<p>In other words, Shakespeare at last clearly
saw that the moral of the <i>aim</i> is the only true
and possible one; so that, according to Brandes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Shakespeare's fundamental principle, for which
he extols him, is that <i>the end justifies the means</i>&mdash;action
at all costs, the absence of all ideals,
moderation in everything, the conservation of
the forms of life once established, and the end
justifying the means. If you add to this a
Chauvinist English patriotism, expressed in all
the historical dramas, a patriotism according
to which the English throne is something sacred,
Englishmen always vanquishing the French, killing
thousands and losing only scores, Joan of
Arc regarded as a witch, and the belief that
Hector and all the Trojans, from whom the
English came, are heroes, while the Greeks
are cowards and traitors, and so forth,&mdash;such
is the view of life of the wisest teacher of life
according to his greatest admirers. And he
who will attentively read Shakespeare's works
can not fail to recognize that the description
of this Shakespearian view of life by his admirers
is quite correct.</p>

<p>The merit of every poetic work depends on
three things:</p>

<p>(1) The subject of the work: the deeper the
subject, <i>i.e.</i>, the more important it is to the
life of mankind, the higher is the work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The external beauty achieved by technical
methods proper to the particular kind of
art. Thus, in dramatic art, the technical
method will be a true individuality of language,
corresponding to the characters, a natural, and
at the same time touching plot, a correct scenic
rendering of the demonstration and development
of emotion, and the feeling of measure
in all that is represented.</p>

<p>(3) Sincerity, <i>i.e.</i>, that the author should
himself keenly feel what he expresses. Without
this condition there can be no work of art,
as the essence of art consists in the contemplation
of the work of art being infected with the
author's feeling. If the author does not actually
feel what he expresses, then the recipient
can not become infected with the feeling
of the author, does not experience any feeling,
and the production can no longer be classified
as a work of art.</p>

<p>The subject of Shakespeare's pieces, as is
seen from the demonstrations of his greatest
admirers, is the lowest, most vulgar view of
life, which regards the external elevation of
the lords of the world as a genuine distinction,
despises the crowd, <i>i.e.</i>, the working classes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&mdash;repudiates
not only all religious, but also all
humanitarian, strivings directed to the betterment
of the existing order.</p>

<p>The second condition also, with the exception
of the rendering of the scenes in which the
movement of feelings is expressed, is quite
absent in Shakespeare. He does not grasp
the natural character of the positions of his
personages, nor the language of the persons
represented, nor the feeling of measure without
which no work can be artistic.</p>

<p>The third and most important condition,
sincerity, is completely absent in all Shakespeare's
works. In all of them one sees intentional
artifice; one sees that he is not <i>in earnest</i>,
but that he is playing with words.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>Shakespeare's works do not satisfy the
demands of all art, and, besides this, their
tendency is of the lowest and most immoral.
What then signifies the great fame these works
have enjoyed for more than a hundred years?</p>

<p>Many times during my life I have had occasion
to argue about Shakespeare with his
admirers, not only with people little sensitive
to poetry, but with those who keenly felt poetic
beauty, such as Turgenef, Fet,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and others,
and every time I encountered one and the same
attitude toward my objection to the praises of
Shakespeare. I was not refuted when I pointed
out Shakespeare's defects; they only condoled
with me for my want of comprehension, and
urged upon me the necessity of recognizing
the extraordinary supernatural grandeur of
Shakespeare, and they did not explain to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
in what the beauties of Shakespeare consisted,
but were merely vaguely and exaggeratedly
enraptured with the whole of Shakespeare,
extolling some favorite passages: the unbuttoning
of Lear's button, Falstaff's lying, Lady
Macbeth's ineffaceable spots, Hamlet's exhortation
to his father's ghost, "forty thousand
brothers," etc.</p>

<p>"Open Shakespeare," I used to say to these
admirers, "wherever you like, or wherever it
may chance, you will see that you will never
find ten consecutive lines which are comprehensible,
unartificial, natural to the character
that says them, and which produce an artistic
impression." (This experiment may be made by
any one. And either at random, or according
to their own choice.) Shakespeare's admirers
opened pages in Shakespeare's dramas, and
without paying any attention to my criticisms
as to why the selected ten lines did not satisfy
the most elementary demands of esthetic and
common sense, they were enchanted with the
very thing which to me appeared absurd, incomprehensible,
and inartistic. So that, in
general, when I endeavored to get from Shakespeare's
worshipers an explanation of his great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>ness,
I met in them exactly the same attitude
which I have met, and which is usually met,
in the defenders of any dogmas accepted not
through reason, but through faith. It is this
attitude of Shakespeare's admirers toward
their object&mdash;an attitude which may be seen
also in all the mistily indefinite essays and conversations
about Shakespeare&mdash;which gave me
the key to the understanding of the cause of
Shakespeare's fame. There is but one explanation
of this wonderful fame: it is one of
those epidemic "suggestions" to which men
constantly have been and are subject. Such
"suggestion" always has existed and does
exist in the most varied spheres of life. As
glaring instances, considerable in scope and
in deceitful influence, one may cite the medieval
Crusades which afflicted, not only adults, but
even children, and the individual "suggestions,"
startling in their senselessness, such as
faith in witches, in the utility of torture for the
discovery of the truth, the search for the elixir
of life, the philosopher's stone, or the passion
for tulips valued at several thousand guldens
a bulb which took hold of Holland. Such
irrational "suggestions" always have been ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>isting,
and still exist, in all spheres of human
life&mdash;religious, philosophical, political, economical,
scientific, artistic, and, in general,
literary&mdash;and people clearly see the insanity of
these suggestions only when they free themselves
from them. But, as long as they are
under their influence, the suggestions appear
to them so certain, so true, that to argue about
them is regarded as neither necessary nor
possible. With the development of the printing
press, these epidemics became especially
striking.</p>

<p>With the development of the press, it has
now come to pass that so soon as any event,
owing to casual circumstances, receives an
especially prominent significance, immediately
the organs of the press announce this significance.
As soon as the press has brought
forward the significance of the event, the public
devotes more and more attention to it.
The attention of the public prompts the press
to examine the event with greater attention
and in greater detail. The interest of the
public further increases, and the organs of
the press, competing with one another, satisfy
the public demand. The public is still more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
interested; the press attributes yet more significance
to the event. So that the importance
of the event, continually growing, like a lump
of snow, receives an appreciation utterly inappropriate
to its real significance, and this appreciation,
often exaggerated to insanity, is retained
so long as the conception of life of the leaders
of the press and of the public remains the same.
There are innumerable examples of such an
inappropriate estimation which, in our time,
owing to the mutual influence of press and
public on one another, is attached to the most
insignificant subjects. A striking example of
such mutual influence of the public and the
press was the excitement in the case of Dreyfus,
which lately caught hold of the whole world.</p>

<p>The suspicion arose that some captain of
the French staff was guilty of treason. Whether
because this particular captain was a Jew, or
because of some special internal party disagreements
in French society, the press attached a
somewhat prominent interest to this event,
whose like is continually occurring without
attracting any one's attention, and without
being able to interest even the French military,
still less the whole world. The public turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
its attention to this incident, the organs of the
press, mutually competing, began to describe,
examine, discuss the event; the public was yet
more interested; the press answered to the
demand of the public, and the lump of snow
began to grow and grow, till before our eyes
it attained such a bulk that there was not a
family where controversies did not rage about
"l'affaire." The caricature by Caran d'Ache
representing at first a peaceful family resolved
to talk no more about Dreyfus, and then, like
exasperated furies, members of the same family
fighting with each other, quite correctly
expressed the attitude of the whole of the reading
world to the question about Dreyfus.
People of foreign nationalities, who could not
be interested in the question whether a French
officer was a traitor or not&mdash;people, moreover,
who could know nothing of the development
of the case&mdash;all divided themselves for and
against Dreyfus, and the moment they met they
talked and argued about Dreyfus, some asserting
his guilt with assurance, others denying it with
equal assurance. Only after the lapse of some
years did people begin to awake from the
"suggestion" and to understand that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
could not possibly know whether Dreyfus was
guilty or not, and that each one had thousands
of subjects much more near to him and
interesting than the case of Dreyfus.</p>

<p>Such infatuations take place in all spheres,
but they are especially noticeable in the sphere
of literature, as the press naturally occupies
itself the more keenly with the affairs of the
press, and they are particularly powerful in
our time when the press has received such an
unnatural development. It continually happens
that people suddenly begin to extol some
most insignificant works, in exaggerated language,
and then, if these works do not correspond
to the prevailing view of life, they suddenly
become utterly indifferent to them, and forget
both the works themselves and their former
attitude toward them.</p>

<p>So within my recollection, in the forties,
there was in the sphere of art the laudation and
glorification of Eug&egrave;ne Sue, and Georges Sand;
and in the social sphere Fourier; in the philosophical
sphere, Comte and Hegel; in the scientific
sphere, Darwin.</p>

<p>Sue is quite forgotten, Georges Sand is being
forgotten and replaced by the writings of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Zola and the Decadents, Beaudelaire, Verlaine,
Maeterlinck, and others. Fourier with his
phalansteries is quite forgotten, his place being
taken by Marx. Hegel, who justified the
existing order, and Comte, who denied the
necessity of religious activity in mankind, and
Darwin with his law of struggle, still hold on,
but are beginning to be forgotten, being replaced
by the teaching of Nietzsche, which,
altho utterly extravagant, unconsidered, misty,
and vicious in its bearing, yet corresponds
better with existing tendencies. Thus sometimes
artistic, philosophic, and, in general,
literary crazes suddenly arise and are as quickly
forgotten. But it also happens that such
crazes, having arisen in consequence of special
reasons accidentally favoring to their establishment,
correspond in such a degree to the
views of life spread in society, and especially
in literary circles, that they are maintained for
a long time. As far back as in the time of
Rome, it was remarked that often books have
their own very strange fates: consisting in
failure notwithstanding their high merits, and
in enormous undeserved success notwithstanding
their triviality. The saying arose: "pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
captu lectoris habent sua fata libelli"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
that the fate of books depends on the understanding
of those who read them. There
was harmony between Shakespeare's writings
and the view of life of those amongst whom
his fame arose. And this fame has been, and
still is, maintained owing to Shakespeare's
works continuing to correspond to the life
concept of those who support this fame.</p>

<p>Until the end of the eighteenth century
Shakespeare not only failed to gain any special
fame in England, but was valued less than his
contemporary dramatists: Ben Jonson, Fletcher,
Beaumont, and others. His fame originated
in Germany, and thence was transferred to
England. This happened for the following
reason:</p>

<p>Art, especially dramatic art, demanding for
its realization great preparations, outlays, and
labor, was always religious, <i>i.e.</i>, its object was
to stimulate in men a clearer conception of
that relation of man to God which had, at that
time, been attained by the leading men of the
circles interested in art.</p>

<p>So it was bound to be from its own nature,
and so, as a matter of fact, has it always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
been among all nations&mdash;Egyptians, Hindus,
Chinese, Greeks&mdash;commencing in some remote
period of human life. And it has always happened
that, with the coarsening of religious
forms, art has more and more diverged from
its original object (according to which it could
be regarded as an important function&mdash;almost
an act of worship), and, instead of serving
religious objects, it strove for worldly aims,
seeking to satisfy the demands of the crowd
or of the powerful, <i>i.e.</i>, the aims of recreation
and amusement. This deviation of art from
its true and high vocation took place everywhere,
and even in connection with Christianity.</p>

<p>The first manifestations of Christian art
were services in churches: in the administration
of the sacraments and the ordinary
liturgy. When, in course of time, the forms
of art as used in worship became insufficient,
there appeared the Mysteries, describing those
events which were regarded as the most important
in the Christian religious view of life.
When, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
the center of gravity of Christian teaching
was more and more transferred, the worship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of Christ as God, and the interpretation and
following of His teaching, the form of Mysteries
describing external Christian events
became insufficient, and new forms were
demanded. As the expression of the aspirations
which gave rise to these changes, there
appeared the Moralities, dramatic representations
in which the characters were personifications
of Christian virtues and their opposite
vices.</p>

<p>But allegories, owing to the very fact of their
being works of art of a lower order, could not
replace the former religious dramas, and yet
no new forms of dramatic art corresponding to
the conception now entertained of Christianity,
according to which it was regarded as a teaching
of life, had yet been found. Hence, dramatic
art, having no foundation, came in all
Christian countries to swerve farther and
farther from its proper use and object, and,
instead of serving God, it took to serving the
crowd (by crowd, I mean, not simply the masses
of common people, but the majority of immoral
or unmoral men, indifferent to the higher
problems of human life). This deviation was,
moreover, encouraged by the circumstance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that, at this very time, the Greek thinkers,
poets, and dramatists, hitherto unknown in the
Christian world, were discovered and brought
back into favor. From all this it followed that,
not having yet had time to work out their own
form of dramatic art corresponding to the new
conception entertained of Christianity as being
a teaching of life, and, at the same time, recognizing
the previous form of Mysteries and
Moralities as insufficient, the writers of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in their search
for a new form, began to imitate the newly
discovered Greek models, attracted by their
elegance and novelty.</p>

<p>Since those who could principally avail
themselves of dramatic representations were
the powerful of this world: kings, princes,
courtiers, the least religious people, not only
utterly indifferent to the questions of religion,
but in most cases completely depraved&mdash;therefore,
in satisfying the demands of its
audience, the drama of the fifteenth and sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries entirely gave
up all religious aim. It came to pass that the
drama, which formerly had such a lofty and
religious significance, and which can, on this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
condition alone, occupy an important place
in human life, became, as in the time of Rome,
a spectacle, an amusement, a recreation&mdash;<i>only</i>
with this difference, that in Rome the
spectacles existed for the whole people, whereas
in the Christian world of the fifteenth, sixteenth,
and seventeenth centuries they were
principally meant for depraved kings and the
higher classes. Such was the case with the
Spanish, English, Italian, and French drama.</p>

<p>The dramas of that time, principally composed,
in all these countries, according to
ancient Greek models, or taken from poems,
legends, or biographies, naturally reflected
the characteristics of their respective nationalities:
in Italy comedies were chiefly elaborated,
with humorous positions and persons.
In Spain there flourished the worldly drama,
with complicated plots and historical heroes.
The peculiarities of the English drama were
the coarse incidents of murders, executions, and
battles taking place on the stage, and popular,
humorous interludes. Neither the Italian nor
the Spanish nor the English drama had European
fame, but they all enjoyed success in
their own countries. General fame, owing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the elegance of its language and the talent of
its writers, was possessed only by the French
drama, distinguished by its strict adherence
to the Greek models, and especially to the law
of the three Unities.</p>

<p>So it continued till the end of the eighteenth
century, at which time this happened: In Germany,
which had not produced even passable
dramatic writers (there was a weak and little
known writer, Hans Sachs), all educated people,
together with Frederick the Great, bowed
down before the French pseudo-classical drama.
Yet at this very time there appeared in Germany
a group of educated and talented writers and
poets, who, feeling the falsity and coldness of
the French drama, endeavored to find a new
and freer dramatic form. The members of
this group, like all the upper classes of the
Christian world at that time, were under the
charm and influence of the Greek classics,
and, being utterly indifferent to religious questions,
they thought that if the Greek drama,
describing the calamities and sufferings and
strife of its heroes, represented the highest
dramatic ideal, then such a description of the
sufferings and the struggles of heroes would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a sufficient subject in the Christian world, too,
if only the narrow demands of pseudo-classicalism
were rejected. These men, not understanding
that, for the Greeks, the strife and
sufferings of their heroes had a religious significance,
imagined that they needed only to
reject the inconvenient law of the three Unities,
without introducing into the drama any religious
element corresponding to their time,
in order that the drama should have sufficient
scope in the representation of various moments
in the lives of historical personages and, in general,
of strong human passions. Exactly this
kind of drama existed at that time among
the kindred English people, and, becoming
acquainted with it, the Germans decided that
precisely such should be the drama of the new
period.</p>

<p>Thereupon, because of the clever development
of scenes which constituted Shakespeare's
peculiarity, they chose Shakespeare's
dramas in preference to all other English dramas,
excluding those which were not in the
least inferior, but were even superior, to Shakespeare.
At the head of the group stood Goethe,
who was then the dictator of public opinion in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
esthetic questions. He it was who, partly owing
to a desire to destroy the fascination of
the false French art, partly owing to his desire
to give a greater scope to his own dramatic
writing, but chiefly through the agreement of
his view of life with Shakespeare's, declared
Shakespeare a great poet. When this error
was announced by an authority like Goethe,
all those esthetic critics who did not understand
art threw themselves on it like crows on carrion
and began to discover in Shakespeare beauties
which did not exist, and to extol them. These
men, German esthetic critics, for the most
part utterly devoid of esthetic feeling, without
that simple, direct artistic sensibility which, for
people with a feeling for art, clearly distinguishes
esthetic impressions from all others,
but believing the authority which had recognized
Shakespeare as a great poet, began to
praise the whole of Shakespeare indiscriminately,
especially distinguishing such passages
as struck them by their effects, or which
expressed thoughts corresponding to their
views of life, imagining that these effects and
these thoughts constitute the essence of what
is called art. These men acted as blind men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
would act who endeavored to find diamonds
by touch among a heap of stones they were
fingering. As the blind man would for a long
time strenuously handle the stones and in the
end would come to no other conclusion than
that all stones are precious and especially so
the smoothest, so also these esthetic critics,
without artistic feeling, could not but come
to similar results in relation to Shakespeare.
To give the greater force to their praise of the
whole of Shakespeare, they invented esthetic
theories according to which it appeared that
no definite religious view of life was necessary
for works of art in general, and especially for
the drama; that for the purpose of the drama
the representation of human passions and
characters was quite sufficient; that not only
was an internal religious illumination of what
was represented unnecessary, but art should
be objective, <i>i.e.</i>, should represent events
quite independently of any judgment of good
and evil. As these theories were founded on
Shakespeare's own views of life, it naturally
turned out that the works of Shakespeare
satisfied these theories and therefore were the
height of perfection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>It is these people who are chiefly responsible
for Shakespeare's fame. It was principally
owing to their writings that the interaction
took place between writers and public which
expressed itself, and is still expressing itself,
in an insane worship of Shakespeare which
has no rational foundation. These esthetic
critics have written profound treatises about
Shakespeare. Eleven thousand volumes have
been written about him, and a whole science
of Shakespearology composed; while the public,
on the one hand, took more and more interest,
and the learned critics, on the other hand,
gave further and further explanations, adding
to the confusion.</p>

<p>So that the first cause of Shakespeare's fame
was that the Germans wished to oppose to the
cold French drama, of which they had grown
weary, and which, no doubt, was tedious
enough, a livelier and freer one. The second
cause was that the young German writers
required a model for writing their own
dramas. The third and principal cause was
the activity of the learned and zealous esthetic
German critics without esthetic feeling, who
invented the theory of objective art, deliber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>ately
rejecting the religious essence of the
drama.</p>

<p>"But," I shall be asked, "what do you
understand by the word's religious essence of
the drama? May not what you are demanding
for the drama, religious instruction, or didactics,
be called 'tendency,' a thing incompatible
with true art?" I reply that by the religious
essence of art I understand not the direct inculcation
of any religious truths in an artistic
guise, and not an allegorical demonstration
of these truths, but the exhibition of a definite
view of life corresponding to the highest religious
understanding of a given time, which,
serving as the motive for the composition of
the drama, penetrates, to the knowledge of
the author, through all of his work. So it has
always been with true art, and so it is with
every true artist in general and especially the
dramatist. Hence&mdash;as it was when the drama
was a serious thing, and as it should be according
to the essence of the matter&mdash;that man
alone can write a drama who has something to
say to men, and something which is of the greatest
importance for them: about man's relation
to God, to the Universe, to the All, the Eternal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Infinite. But when, thanks to the German
theories about objective art, the idea was
established that, for the drama, this was quite
unnecessary, then it is obvious how a writer
like Shakespeare&mdash;who had not got developed
in his mind the religious convictions proper
to his time, who, in fact, had no convictions
at all, but heaped up in his drama all possible
events, horrors, fooleries, discussions, and
effects&mdash;could appear to be a dramatic writer
of the greatest genius.</p>

<p>But these are all external reasons. The
fundamental inner cause of Shakespeare's
fame was and is this: that his dramas were
"pro captu lectoris," <i>i.e.</i>, they corresponded
to the irreligious and immoral frame of mind
of the upper classes of his time.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the last century, when
Goethe was dictator of philosophic thought
and esthetic laws, a series of casual circumstances
made him praise Shakespeare. The
esthetic critics caught up this praise and took
to writing their lengthy, misty, learned articles,
and the great European public began to
be enchanted with Shakespeare. The critics,
answering to the popular interest, and endeavoring
to compete with one another, wrote new
and ever new essays about Shakespeare; the
readers and spectators on their side were increasingly
confirmed in their admiration, and
Shakespeare's fame, like a lump of snow, kept
growing and growing, until in our time it has
attained that insane worship which obviously
has no other foundation than "suggestion."</p>

<p>Shakespeare finds no rival, not even approximately,
either among the old or the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
writers. Here are some of the tributes paid
to him.</p>

<p>"Poetic truth is the brightest flower in the
crown of Shakespeare's merits;" "Shakespeare
is the greatest moralist of all times;"
"Shakespeare exhibits such many-sidedness
and such objectivism that they carry him beyond
the limits of time and nationality;"
"Shakespeare is the greatest genius that has
hitherto existed;" "For the creation of tragedy,
comedy, history, idyll, idyllistic comedy,
esthetic idyll, for the profoundest presentation,
or for any casually thrown off, passing piece of
verse, he is the only man. He not only wields
an unlimited power over our mirth and our
tears, over all the workings of passion, humor,
thought, and observation, but he possesses also
an infinite region full of the phantasy of fiction,
of a horrifying and an amusing character.
He possesses penetration both in the world of
fiction and of reality, and above this reigns one
and the same truthfulness to character and to
nature, and the same spirit of humanity;"
"To Shakespeare the epithet of Great comes
of itself; and if one adds that independently
of his greatness he has, further, become the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
reformer of all literature, and, moreover, has
in his works not only expressed the phenomenon
of life as it was in his day, but also, by
the genius of thought which floated in the air
has prophetically forestalled the direction that
the social spirit was going to take in the future
(of which we see a striking example in Hamlet),&mdash;one
may, without hesitation, say that Shakespeare
was not only a great poet, but the greatest
of all poets who ever existed, and that in the
sphere of poetic creation his only worthy rival
was that same life which in his works he expressed
to such perfection."</p>

<p>The obvious exaggeration of this estimate
proves more conclusively than anything that
it is the consequence, not of common sense,
but of suggestion. The more trivial, the lower,
the emptier a phenomenon is, if only it has
become the subject of suggestion, the more
supernatural and exaggerated is the significance
attributed to it. The Pope is not merely
saintly, but most saintly, and so forth. So
Shakespeare is not merely a good writer, but
the greatest genius, the eternal teacher of man
kind.</p>

<p>Suggestion is always a deceit, and every de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>ceit
is an evil. In truth, the suggestion that
Shakespeare's works are great works of genius,
presenting the height of both esthetic and ethical
perfection, has caused, and is causing, great
injury to men.</p>

<p>This injury is twofold: first, the fall of the
drama, and the replacement of this important
weapon of progress by an empty and immoral
amusement; and secondly, the direct depravation
of men by presenting to them false models
for imitation.</p>

<p>Human life is perfected only through the
development of the religious consciousness,
the only element which permanently unites
men. The development of the religious consciousness
of men is accomplished through
all the sides of man's spiritual activity. One
direction of this activity is in art. One section
of art, perhaps the most influential, is the
drama.</p>

<p>Therefore the drama, in order to deserve
the importance attributed to it, should serve
the development of religious consciousness.
Such has the drama always been, and such it
was in the Christian world. But upon the
appearance of Protestantism in its broader<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
sense, <i>i.e.</i>, the appearance of a new understanding
of Christianity as of a teaching of life, the
dramatic art did not find a form corresponding
to the new understanding of Christianity, and
the men of the Renaissance were carried away
by the imitation of classical art. This was
most natural, but the tendency was bound to
pass, and art had to discover, as indeed it is
now beginning to do, its new form corresponding
to the change in the understanding of
Christianity.</p>

<p>But the discovery of this new form was
arrested by the teaching arising among German
writers at the end of the eighteenth and
beginning of the nineteenth centuries&mdash;as to
so-called objective art, <i>i.e.</i>, art indifferent
to good or evil&mdash;and therein the exaggerated
praise of Shakespeare's dramas, which partly
corresponded to the esthetic teaching of the
Germans, and partly served as material for it.
If there had not been exaggerated praise of
Shakespeare's dramas, presenting them as the
most perfect models, the men of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries would have
had to understand that the drama, to have
a right to exist and to be a serious thing, must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
serve, as it always has served and can not but
do otherwise, the development of the religious
consciousness. And having understood this,
they would have searched for a new form of
drama corresponding to their religious understanding.</p>

<p>But when it was decided that the height of
perfection was Shakespeare's drama, and that
we ought to write as he did, not only without
any religious, but even without any moral,
significance, then all writers of dramas in imitation
of him began to compose such empty
pieces as are those of Goethe, Schiller, Hugo,
and, in Russia, of Pushkin, or the chronicles
of Ostrovski, Alexis Tolstoy, and an innumerable
number of other more or less celebrated
dramatic productions which fill all the theaters,
and can be prepared wholesale by any one who
happens to have the idea or desire to write a
play. It is only thanks to such a low, trivial
understanding of the significance of the drama
that there appears among us that infinite
quantity of dramatic works describing men's
actions, positions, characters, and frames of
mind, not only void of any spiritual substance,
but often of any human sense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Let not the reader think that I exclude from
this estimate of contemporary drama the theatrical
pieces I have myself incidentally written.
I recognize them, as well as all the rest,
as not having that religious character which
must form the foundation of the drama of the
future.</p>

<p>The drama, then, the most important branch
of art, has, in our time, become the trivial and
immoral amusement of a trivial and immoral
crowd. The worst of it is, moreover, that to
dramatic art, fallen as low as it is possible to
fall, is still attributed an elevated significance
no longer appropriate to it. Dramatists, actors,
theatrical managers, and the press&mdash;this last
publishing in the most serious tone reports of
theaters and operas&mdash;and the rest, are all
perfectly certain that they are doing something
very worthy and important.</p>

<p>The drama in our time is a great man fallen,
who has reached the last degree of his degradation,
and at the same time continues to pride
himself on his past of which nothing now remains.
The public of our time is like those who mercilessly
amuse themselves over this man once
so great and now in the lowest stage of his fall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is one of the mischievous effects of the
epidemic suggestion about the greatness of
Shakespeare. Another deplorable result of
this worship is the presentation to men of a
false model for imitation. If people wrote of
Shakespeare that for his time he was a good
writer, that he had a fairly good turn for verse,
was an intelligent actor and good stage manager&mdash;even
were this appreciation incorrect
and somewhat exaggerated&mdash;if only it were
moderately true, people of the rising generation
might remain free from Shakespeare's influence.
But when every young man entering
into life in our time has presented to him, as
the model of moral perfection, not the religious
and moral teachers of mankind, but first of
all Shakespeare, concerning whom it has been
decided and is handed down by learned men
from generation to generation, as an incontestable
truth, that he was the greatest poet, the
greatest teacher of life, the young man can
not remain free from this pernicious influence.
When he is reading or listening to Shakespeare
the question for him is no longer whether
Shakespeare be good or bad, but only: In
what consists that extraordinary beauty, both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
esthetic and ethical, of which he has been
assured by learned men whom he respects,
and which he himself neither sees nor feels?
And constraining himself, and distorting his
esthetic and ethical feeling, he tries to conform
to the ruling opinion. He no longer believes
in himself, but in what is said by the learned
people whom he respects. I have experienced
all this. Then reading critical examinations
of the dramas and extracts from books with
explanatory comments, he begins to imagine
that he feels something of the nature of an
artistic impression. The longer this continues,
the more does his esthetical and ethical feeling
become distorted. He ceases to distinguish
directly and clearly what is artistic from an
artificial imitation of art. But, above all,
having assimilated the immoral view of life
which penetrates all Shakespeare's writings, he
loses the capacity of distinguishing good from
evil. And the error of extolling an insignificant,
inartistic writer&mdash;not only not moral, but directly
immoral&mdash;executes its destructive work.</p>

<p>This is why I think that the sooner people
free themselves from the false glorification of
Shakespeare, the better it will be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>First, having freed themselves from this deceit,
men will come to understand that the
drama which has no religious element at its
foundation is not only not an important and
good thing, as it is now supposed to be, but the
most trivial and despicable of things. Having
understood this, they will have to search for,
and work out, a new form of modern drama,
a drama which will serve as the development
and confirmation of the highest stage of religious
consciousness in men.</p>

<p>Secondly, having freed themselves from this
hypnotic state, men will understand that the
trivial and immoral works of Shakespeare and
his imitators, aiming merely at the recreation
and amusement of the spectators, can not
possibly represent the teaching of life, and that,
while there is no true religious drama, the
teaching of life should be sought for in other
sources.</p>

<h2>SHAKESPEARE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD
THE WORKING CLASSES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By Ernest Crosby</span></h3>


<p>"Shakespeare was of us," cries Browning, in his
"Lost Leader," while lamenting the defection of
Wordsworth from the ranks of progress and liberalism&mdash;"Milton
was for us, Burns, Shelley were with
us&mdash;they watch from their graves!" There can,
indeed, be no question of the fidelity to democracy
of Milton, the republican pamphleteer, nor of Burns,
the proud plowman, who proclaimed the fact that
"a man's a man for a' that," nor of Shelley, the
awakened aristocrat, who sang to such as Burns</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Men of England, wherefore plow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the lords who lay ye low?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Shakespeare?&mdash;Shakespeare?&mdash;where is there a
line in Shakespeare to entitle him to a place in this
brotherhood? Is there anything in his plays that is
in the least inconsistent with all that is reactionary?</p>

<p>A glance at Shakespeare's lists of <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>
is sufficient to show that he was unable to conceive
of any situation rising to the dignity of tragedy
in other than royal and ducal circles. It may be
said in explanation of this partiality for high rank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that he was only following the custom of the dramatists
of his time, but this is a poor plea for a man of
great genius, whose business it is precisely to lead
and not to follow. Nor is the explanation altogether
accurate. In his play, the "Pinner of Wakefield,"
first printed in 1599, Robert Greene makes a hero,
and a very stalwart one, of a mere pound-keeper,
who proudly refuses knighthood at the hands of the
king. There were other and earlier plays in vogue
in Shakespeare's day treating of the triumphs of men
of the people, one, for instance, which commemorated
the rise of Sir Thomas Gresham, the merchant's son,
and another, entitled "The History of Richard
Whittington, of his Low Birth, his Great Fortune";
but he carefully avoided such material in seeking
plots for his dramas. Cardinal Wolsey, the butcher's
son, is indeed the hero of "Henry VIII.," but
his humble origin is only mentioned incidentally as
something to be ashamed of. What greater opportunity
for idealizing the common people ever presented
itself to a dramatist than to Shakespeare
when he undertook to draw the character of Joan
of Arc in the second part of "Henry VI."? He
knew how to create noble women&mdash;that is one of his
special glories&mdash;but he not only refuses to see anything
noble in the peasant girl who led France to
victory, but he deliberately insults her memory with
the coarsest and most cruel calumnies. Surely the
lapse of more than a century and a half might have
enabled a man of honor, if not of genius, to do justice
to an enemy of the weaker sex, and if Joan had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
a member of the French royal family we may be sure
that she would have received better treatment.</p>

<p>The question of the aristocratic tendency of the
drama was an active one in Shakespeare's time.
There was a good deal of democratic feeling in the
burghers of London-town, and they resented the
courtly prejudices of their playwrights and their
habit of holding up plain citizens to ridicule upon
the stage, whenever they deigned to present them
at all. The Prolog in Beaumont and Fletcher's
"Knight of the Burning Pestle" gives sufficient evidence
of this. The authors adopted the device of
having a Citizen leap upon the stage and interrupt
the Speaker of the Prolog by shouting</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hold your peace, goodman boy!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Speaker of Prolog: "What do you mean, sir?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Citizen: "That you have no good meaning; this seven<br /></span>
<span class="i1">year there hath been plays at this house. I have observed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">it, you have still girds at citizens."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Citizen goes on to inform the Speaker of the
Prolog that he is a grocer, and to demand that he
"present something notably in honor of the commons
of the city." For a hero he will have "a grocer,
and he shall do admirable things." But this
proved to be a joke over too serious a matter, for at
the first representation of the play in 1611 it was
cried down by the citizens and apprentices, who did
not appreciate its satire upon them, and it was not
revived for many years thereafter. It will not answer,
therefore, to say that the idea of celebrating
the middle and lower classes never occurred to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Shakespeare, for it was a subject of discussion among
his contemporaries.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to construct a play with no
characters but monarchs and their suites, and at
the same time preserve the verisimilitudes of life.
Shakespeare was obliged to make some use of servants,
citizens, and populace. How has he portrayed
them? In one play alone has he given up
the whole stage to them, and it is said that the
"Merry Wives of Windsor" was only written at the
request of Queen Elizabeth, who wished to see Sir
John Falstaff in love. It is from beginning to end
one prolonged "gird at citizens," and we can hardly
wonder that they felt a grievance against the dramatic
profession. In the other plays of Shakespeare
the humbler classes appear for the main part only
occasionally and incidentally. His opinion of them
is indicated more or less picturesquely by the names
which he selects for them. There are, for example,
Bottom, the weaver; Flute, the bellows-maker;
Snout and Sly, tinkers; Quince, the carpenter;
Snug, the joiner; Starveling, the tailor; Smooth,
the silkman; Shallow and Silence, country justices;
Elbow and Hull, constables; Dogberry and Verges,
Fang and Snare, sheriffs' officers; Mouldy, Shadow,
Wart, and Bull-calf, recruits; Feebee, at once a recruit
and a woman's tailor, Pilch and Patch-Breech,
fishermen (though these last two appellations may
be mere nicknames); Potpan, Peter Thump, Simple,
Gobbo, and Susan Grindstone, servants; Speed, "a
clownish servant"; Slender, Pistol, Nym, Sneak,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Doll Tear-sheet, Jane Smile, Costard, Oatcake,
Seacoal, and various anonymous "clowns" and
"fools." Shakespeare rarely gives names of this
character to any but the lowly in life, altho perhaps
we should cite as exceptions Sir Toby Belch
and Sir Andrew Ague-Cheek in "Twelfth Night"; the
vicar, Sir Oliver Mar-Text, in "As You Like It";
Moth, the page, in "Love's Labor Lost," and Froth,
"a foolish gentleman," in "Measure for Measure,"
but none of these personages quite deserves to rank
as an aristocrat. Such a system of nomenclature as
we have exposed is enough of itself to fasten the
stigma of absurdity upon the characters subjected
to it, and their occupations. Most of the trades are
held up for ridicule in "Midsummer Night's
Dream"; Holofernes, the schoolmaster, is made
ridiculous in "Love's Labor Lost," and we are told
of the middle-class Nym, Pistol, and Bardolph that
"three such antics do not amount to a man"
(Henry V., Act 3, Sc. 2). But it is not necessary to
rehearse the various familiar scenes in which these
fantastically named individuals raise a laugh at
their own expense.</p>

<p>The language employed by nobility and royalty
in addressing those of inferior station in Shakespeare's
plays may be taken, perhaps, rather as an
indication of the manners of the times than as an
expression of his own feeling, but even so it must
have been a little galling to the poorer of his auditors.
"Whoreson dog," "whoreson peasant,"
"slave," "you cur," "rogue," "rascal," "dunghill,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
"crack-hemp," and "notorious villain"&mdash;these are a
few of the epithets with which the plays abound.
The Duke of York accosts Thomas Horner, an armorer,
as "base dunghill villain and mechanical"
(Henry VI., Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 3); Gloster speaks
of the warders of the Tower as "dunghill grooms"
(Ib., Part 1, Act 1, Sc. 3), and Hamlet of the grave-digger
as an "ass" and "rude knave." Valentine
tells his servant, Speed, that he is born to be hanged
(Two Gentlemen of Verona, Act 1, Sc. 1), and Gonzalo
pays a like compliment to the boatswain who is
doing his best to save the ship in the "Tempest"
(Act 1, Sc. 1). This boatswain is not sufficiently
impressed by the grandeur of his noble cargo, and
for his pains is called a "brawling, blasphemous, uncharitable
dog," a "cur," a "whoreson, insolent
noise-maker," and a "wide-chapped rascal." Richard
III.'s Queen says to a gardener, who is guilty of
nothing but giving a true report of her lord's deposition
and who shows himself a kind-hearted fellow,
"Thou little better thing than earth," "thou wretch"!
Henry VIII. talks of a "lousy footboy," and the
Duke of Suffolk, when he is about to be killed by
his pirate captor at Dover, calls him "obscure and
lowly swain," "jaded groom," and "base slave,"
dubs his crew "paltry, servile, abject drudges," and
declares that his own head would</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"sooner dance upon bloody pole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than stand uncovered to a vulgar groom."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Henry VI., Part 2, Act 4, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>


<p>Petruchio "wrings Grumio by the ear," and Kath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>erine
beats the same unlucky servant. His master
indulges in such terms as "foolish knave,"
"peasant swain," and "whoreson malthorse drudge"
in addressing him; cries out to his servants, "off with
my boots, you rogues, you villains!" and strikes
them. He pays his compliments to a tailor in the
following lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket thou;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Braved in my own house by a skein of thread!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant!"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Taming of the Shrew, Act 4, Sc. 3.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Joan of Arc speaks of her "contemptible estate"
as a shepherd's daughter, and afterward, denying
her father, calls him "Decrepit miser! base, ignoble
wretch!" (Henry VI., Part 1, Act 1, Sc. 2, and Act
5, Sc. 4.) It is hard to believe that Shakespeare
would have so frequently allowed his characters to
express their contempt for members of the lower
orders of society if he had not had some sympathy
with their opinions.</p>

<p>Shakespeare usually employs the common people
whom he brings upon the stage merely to raise a
laugh (as, for instance, the flea-bitten carriers in the
inn-yard at Rochester, in Henry IV., Part 1, Act 2,
Sc. 1), but occasionally they are scamps as well as
fools. They amuse us when they become hopelessly
entangled in their sentences (<i>vide</i> Romeo and
Juliet, Act 1, Sc. 2), or when Juliet's nurse blunder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>ingly
makes her think that Romeo is slain instead
of Tybalt; but when this same lady, after taking
Romeo's money, espouses the cause of the County
Paris&mdash;or when on the eve of Agincourt we are introduced
to a group of cowardly English soldiers&mdash;or
when Coriolanus points out the poltroonery of the
Roman troops, and says that all would have been
lost "but for our gentlemen," we must feel detestation
for them. Juliet's nurse is not the only disloyal
servant. Shylock's servant, Launcelot Gobbo,
helps Jessica to deceive her father, and Margaret,
the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, brings about the disgrace
of her mistress by fraud. Olivia's waiting-woman
in "Twelfth Night" is honest enough, but she
is none too modest in her language, but in this respect
Dame Quickly in "Henry IV." can easily rival
her. Peter Thump, when forced to a judicial combat
with his master, displays his cowardice, altho in
the end he is successful (Henry VI., Act 2, Part 2,
Sc. 3), and Stephano, a drunken butler, adorns
the stage in the "Tempest." We can not blame
Shakespeare for making use of cutthroats and villains
in developing his plots, but we might have been
spared the jokes which the jailors of Posthumus perpetrate
when they come to lead him to the scaffold,
and the ludicrous English of the clown who supplies
Cleopatra with an asp. The apothecary who
is in such wretched plight that he sells poison to
Romeo in spite of a Draconian law, gives us another
unflattering picture of a tradesman; and when Falstaff
declares, "I would I were a weaver; I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sing psalms or anything," we have a premature reflection
on the Puritan, middle-class conscience and
religion. In "As You Like It," Shakespeare came
near drawing a pastoral sketch of shepherds and
shepherdesses on conventional lines. If he failed to
do so, it was as much from lack of respect for the
keeping of sheep as for the unrealities of pastoral
poetry. Rosalind does not scruple to call the fair
Phebe "foul," and, as for her hands, she says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I saw her hand; she has a leathern hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A freestone colored hand; I verily did think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has a housewife's hand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No one with a high respect for housewifery could
have written that line. When in the same play
Jaques sees the pair of rural lovers, Touchstone and
Audrey, approaching, he cries: "There is, sure, another
flood, and these couples are coming to the ark!
Here come a pair of very strange beasts, which in all
tongues are called fools" (Act 5, Sc. 4). The
clown, Touchstone, speaks of kissing the cow's dugs
which his former sweetheart had milked, and then
marries Audrey in a tempest of buffoonery. Howbeit,
Touchstone remains one of the few rustic characters
of Shakespeare who win our affections, and
at the same time he is witty enough to deserve the
title which Jaques bestows upon him of a "rare
fellow."</p>

<p>Occasionally Shakespeare makes fun of persons
who are somewhat above the lower classes in rank.
I have mentioned those on whom he bestows comi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>cal
names. He indulges in humor also at the expense
of the two Scottish captains, Jamy and Macmorris,
and the honest Welsh captain, Fluellen
(Henry V., Act 3, Sc. 2 <i>et passim</i>), and shall we forget
the inimitable Falstaff? But, while making
every allowance for these diversions into somewhat
nobler quarters (the former of which are explained
by national prejudices), do they form serious exceptions
to the rule, and can Falstaff be taken, for instance,
as a representative of the real aristocracy?
As Queen and courtiers watched his antics on the
stage, we may be sure that it never entered their
heads that the "girds" were directed at them or
their kind.</p>

<p>The appearance on Shakespeare's stage of a man
of humble birth who is virtuous without being ridiculous
is so rare an event that it is worth while to
enumerate the instances. Now and then a servant
or other obscure character is made use of as a mere
lay figure of which nothing good or evil can be predicated,
but usually they are made more or less absurd.
Only at long intervals do we see persons of
this class at once serious and upright. As might
have been expected, it is more often the servant than
any other member of the lower classes to whom
Shakespeare attributes good qualities, for the servant
is a sort of attachment to the gentleman and
shines with the reflection of his virtues. The noblest
quality which Shakespeare can conceive of in a servant
is loyalty, and in "Richard II." (Act 5, Sc. 3)
he gives us a good example in the character of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
groom who remains faithful to the king even when
the latter is cast into prison. In "Cymbeline" we
are treated to loyalty <i>ad nauseam</i>. The king orders
Pisanio, a trusty servant, to be tortured without
cause, and his reply is,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sir, my life is yours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I humbly set it at your will."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 4, Sc. 3.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>In "King Lear" a good servant protests against the
cruelty of Regan and Cornwall toward Gloucester,
and is killed for his courage. "Give me my sword,"
cries Regan. "A peasant stand up thus!" (Act 3,
Sc. 7). And other servants also show sympathy for
the unfortunate earl. We all remember the fool who,
almost alone, was true to Lear, but, then, of course,
he was a fool. In "Timon of Athens" we have
an unusual array of good servants, but it is doubtful
if Shakespeare wrote the play, and these characters
make his authorship more doubtful. Flaminius,
Timon's servant, rejects a bribe with scorn (Act
3, Sc. 1). Another of his servants expresses his contempt
for his master's false friends (Act 3, Sc. 3),
and when Timon finally loses his fortune and his
friends forsake him, his servants stand by him. "Yet
do our hearts wear Timon's livery" (Act 4, Sc. 2).
Adam, the good old servant in "As You Like It," who
follows his young master Orlando into exile, is, like
Lear's fool, a noteworthy example of the loyal servitor.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Master, go on, and I will follow thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the last gasp with truth and loyalty."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 2, Sc. 3.)</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Shakespeare takes care to point out that such
fidelity in servants is most uncommon and a relic of
the good old times&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O good old man, bow well in thee appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The constant service of the antique world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When service sweat for duty, nor for meed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not for the fashion of these times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When none will sweat but for promotion."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Outside the ranks of domestic servants we find a
few cases of honorable poverty in Shakespeare. In
the play just quoted, Corin, the old shepherd, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sir, I am a true laborer; I earn that I eat, get that I wear;
owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of
my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck."<br />
<span class='ref'>(As You Like It, Act 3, Sc. 2.)</span></p></div>

<p>in short, an ideal proletarian from the point of view
of the aristocrat.</p>

<p>The "Winter's Tale" can boast of another good shepherd
(Act 3, Sc. 3), but he savors a little of burlesque.
"Macbeth" has several humble worthies. There is
a good old man in the second act (Sc. 2), and a good
messenger in the fourth (Sc. 2). King Duncan
praises highly the sergeant who brings the news of
Macbeth's victory, and uses language to him such as
Shakespeare's yeomen are not accustomed to hear
(Act 1, Sc. 2). And in "Antony and Cleopatra" we
make the acquaintance of several exemplary common
soldiers. Shakespeare puts flattering words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
into the mouth of Henry V. when he addresses the
troops before Agincourt:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day shall gentle his condition."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 4, Sc. 4.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>And at Harfleur he is even more complaisant:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And you, good yeomen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose limbs were made in England, shew us here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The metal of your pasture; let us swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there is none of you so mean and base<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath not noble luster in your eyes." (Act 3, Sc. 1.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rank and file always fare well before a battle.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, it's 'Tommy this' and 'Tommy that' an' 'Tommy, go away';<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it's 'Thank you, Mr. Atkins,' when the band begins to play."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I should like to add some instances from Shakespeare's
works of serious and estimable behavior
on the part of individuals representing the lower
classes, or of considerate treatment of them on the
part of their "betters," but I have been unable to
find any, and the meager list must end here.</p>

<p>But to return to Tommy Atkins. He is no longer
Mr. Atkins after the battle. Montjoy, the French
herald, comes to the English king under a flag of
truce and asks that they be permitted to bury their
dead and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sort our nobles from our common men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many of our princes (wo the while!)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In blood of princes." (Henry V., Act 4, Sc. 7.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With equal courtesy Richard III., on Bosworth
field, speaks of his opponents to the gentlemen around
him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Remember what you are to cope withal&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scum of Bretagne and base lackey peasants."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 5, Sc. 3.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>But Shakespeare does not limit such epithets to
armies. Having, as we have seen, a poor opinion
of the lower classes, taken man by man, he thinks, if
anything, still worse of them taken <i>en masse</i>, and at
his hands a crowd of plain workingmen fares worst
of all. "Hempen home-spuns," Puck calls them,
and again</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That work for bread upon Athenian stalls."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bottom, their leader, is, according to Oberon, a
"hateful fool," and according to Puck, the "shallowest
thick-skin of that barren sort" (Midsummer
Night's Dream, Act 3, Scs. 1 and 2, Act 4, Sc. 1).
Bottom's advice to his players contains a small galaxy
of compliments:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In any case let Thisby have clean linen, and let not him
that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out
for the lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onion
or garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath, and I do not
doubt to hear them say, it is a sweet comedy."<br />
<span class='ref'>(Ib., Act 4, Sc. 2.)</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p></div>



<p>The matter of the breath of the poor weighs upon
Shakespeare and his characters. Cleopatra shudders
at the thought that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"mechanic slaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greasy aprons, rules and hammers, shall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forced to drink their vapor."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Antony and Cleopatra, Act 5, Sc. 2.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Coriolanus has his sense of smell especially developed.
He talks of the "stinking breaths" of
the people (Act 2, Sc. 1), and in another place
says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You common cry of curs, whose breath I hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As reek of rotten fens, whose love I prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the dead carcasses of unburied men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That do corrupt the air, I banish you,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and he goes on to taunt them with cowardice (Act
3, Sc. 3). They are the "mutable, rank-scented
many" (Act 3, Sc. 1). His friend Menenius is
equally complimentary to his fellow citizens. "You
are they," says he,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That make the air unwholesome, when you cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your stinking, greasy caps, in hooting at<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coriolanus's exile."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 4, Sc. 7.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>And he laughs at the "apron-men" of Cominius
and their "breath of garlic-eaters" (Act 4, Sc. 7).
When Coriolanus is asked to address the people, he
replies by saying: "Bid them wash their faces, and
keep their teeth clean" (Act 2, Sc. 3). According<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to Shakespeare, the Roman populace had made no
advance in cleanliness in the centuries between Coriolanus
and C&aelig;sar. Casca gives a vivid picture of
the offer of the crown to Julius, and his rejection of
it: "And still as he refused it the rabblement
shouted, and clapped their chapped hands, and
threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such
a deal of stinking breath, because C&aelig;sar refused the
crown, that it had almost choked C&aelig;sar, for he
swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own
part I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips
and receiving the bad air." And he calls them the
"tag-rag people" (Julius C&aelig;sar, Act 1, Sc. 2).
The play of "Coriolanus" is a mine of insults to the
people and it becomes tiresome to quote them. The
hero calls them the "beast with many heads" (Act
4, Sc. 3), and again he says to the crowd:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Make yourself scabs?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First Citizen. We have ever your good word.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Coriolanus. He that will give good words to ye will flatter<br /></span>

<span class="i1">That like not peace nor war? The one affrights you,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where he would find you lions, finds you hares;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where foxes, geese; you are no surer, no,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Deserves your hate; and your affections are<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And call him noble that was now your hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Him vile that was your garland."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 1, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>His mother, Volumnia, is of like mind. She calls
the people "our general louts" (Act 3, Sc. 2). She
says to Junius Brutus, the tribune of the people:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas you incensed the rabble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I can of those mysteries which Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not leave Earth to know."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 4, Sc. 2).</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same play Cominius talks of the "dull tribunes"
and "fusty plebeians" (Act 1, Sc. 9). Menenius
calls them "beastly plebeians" (Act 2, Sc. 1), refers
to their "multiplying spawn" (Act 2, Sc. 2), and
says to the crowd:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Rome and her rats are at the point of battle."<br />
<span class='ref'>(Act 1, Sc. 2).</span></p></div>

<p>The dramatist makes the mob cringe before Coriolanus.
When he appears, the stage directions
show that the "citizens steal away." (Act 1, Sc. 1.)</p>

<p>As the Roman crowd of the time of Coriolanus is
fickle, so is that of C&aelig;sar's. Brutus and Antony
sway them for and against his assassins with ease:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"First Citizen. This C&aelig;sar was a tyrant.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The Tribune Marullus reproaches them with having
forgotten Pompey, and calls them</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He persuades them not to favor C&aelig;sar, and when
they leave him he asks his fellow tribune, Flavius,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See, whe'r their basest metal be not moved?"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 1, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Flavius also treats them with scant courtesy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this a holiday? What! you know not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being mechanical, you ought not walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a laboring day without the sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your profession?"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Ib.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>The populace of England is as changeable as that
of Rome, if Shakespeare is to be believed. The
Archbishop of York, who had espoused the cause of
Richard II. against Henry IV., thus soliloquizes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their over greedy love hath surfeited;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An habitation giddy and unsure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou fond many! With what loud applause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst thou beat Heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he was what thou would'st have him be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now being trimmed in thine own desires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And howlst to find it."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Henry IV., Part 2, Act 1, Sc. 3.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Gloucester in "Henry VI." (Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 4)
notes the fickleness of the masses. He says, addressing
his absent wife:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The abject people, gazing on thy face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When she arrives upon the scene in disgrace, she
says to him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Look how they gaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how the giddy multitude do point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, Gloster, hide thee from their hateful looks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And she calls the crowd a "rabble" (Ib.), a term
also used in "Hamlet" (Act 4, Sc. 5). Again, in part
III. of "Henry VI.," Clifford, dying on the battlefield
while fighting for King Henry, cries:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The common people swarm like summer flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who shines now but Henry's enemies?"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 2, Sc. 6.)</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Henry himself, conversing with the keepers
who have imprisoned him in the name of Edward
IV., says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, simple men! you know not what you swear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look, as I blow this feather from my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the air blows it to me again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obeying with my wind when I do blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yielding to another when it blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commanded always by the greater gust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the lightness of you common men."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Ib., Act 3, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Suffolk, in the First Part of the same trilogy (Act
5, Sc. 5), talks of "worthless peasants," meaning,
perhaps, "property-less peasants," and when Salisbury
comes to present the demands of the people, he
calls him</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"the Lord Ambassador<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king,"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Part 2, Act 3, Sc. 2.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>and says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis like the Commons, rude unpolished hinds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could send such message to their sovereign."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Cardinal Beaufort mentions the "uncivil kernes
of Ireland" (Ib., Part 2, Act 3, Sc. 1), and in the
same play the crowd makes itself ridiculous by
shouting, "A miracle," when the fraudulent beggar
Simpcox, who had pretended to be lame and blind,
jumps over a stool to escape a whipping (Act 2, Sc.
1). Queen Margaret receives petitioners with the
words "Away, base cullions" (Ib., Act 1, Sc. 3), and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
among other flattering remarks applied here and
there to the lower classes we may cite the epithets
"ye rascals, ye rude slaves," addressed to a crowd
by a porter in Henry VIII., and that of "lazy knaves"
given by the Lord Chamberlain to the porters for
having let in a "trim rabble" (Act 5, Sc. 3). Hubert,
in King John, presents us with an unvarnished
picture of the common people receiving the news of
Prince Arthur's death:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whilst his iron did on his anvil cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing on slippers (which his nimble haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told of a many thousand warlike French<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another lean, unwashed artificer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur's death."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 4, Sc. 2.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Macbeth, while sounding the murderers whom he
intends to employ, and who say to him, "We are
men, my liege," answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ay, in the catalogue, ye go for men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoughs, water-sugs, and demi-wolves, are cleped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All by the name of dogs."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 3, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>As Coriolanus is held up to our view as a pattern
of noble bearing toward the people, so Richard II.
condemns the courteous behavior of the future
Henry IV. on his way into banishment. He says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ourselves, and Bushy, Bagot here and Green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observed his courtship to the common people;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he did seem to dive into their hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With humble and familiar courtesy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What reverence he did throw away on slaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And patient overbearing of his fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As 'twere to banish their effects with him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brace of draymen did God speed him well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had the tribute of his supple knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends.'"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Richard II., Act 1, Sc. 4.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>The King of France, in "All's Well that Ends
Well," commends to Bertram the example of his late
father in his relations with his inferiors:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who were below him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He used as creatures of another place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowed his eminent top to their low ranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making them proud of his humility<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be a copy to these younger times."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 1, Sc. 2.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Shakespeare had no fondness for these "younger
times," with their increasing suggestion of democracy.
Despising the masses, he had no sympathy
with the idea of improving their condition or increasing
their power. He saw the signs of the times
with foreboding, as did his hero, Hamlet:</p>

<p>"By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have
taken note of it; the age has grown so picked, that
the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the
courtier, he galls his kibe." There can easily be
too much liberty, according to Shakespeare&mdash;"too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
much liberty, my Lucio, liberty" (Measure for
Measure, Act 1, Sc. 3), but the idea of too much
authority is foreign to him. Claudio, himself under
arrest, sings its praises:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Thus can the demi-god, Authority,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make us pay down for our offense by weight,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words of Heaven;&mdash;on whom it will, it will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Ib.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Ulysses, in "Troilus and Cressida" (Act 1, Sc. 3),
delivers a long panegyric upon authority, rank, and
degree, which may be taken as Shakespeare's confession
of faith:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Degree being vizarded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' unworthiest shews as fairly in the mask.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is no hint in this eloquent apostrophe of
the difficulty of determining among men who shall
be the sun and who the satellite, nor of the fact that
the actual arrangements, in Shakespeare's time, at
any rate, depended altogether upon that very force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
which Ulysses deprecates. In another scene in the
same play the wily Ithacan again gives way to his
passion for authority and eulogizes somewhat extravagantly
the paternal, prying, omnipresent State:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The providence that's in a watchful state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finds bottom in th' incomprehensive deeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a mystery (with which relation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Durst never meddle) in the soul of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which hath an operation more divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than breath or pen can give expressure to."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 3, Sc. 3.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>The State to which Ulysses refers is of course a
monarchical State, and the idea of democracy is abhorrent
to Shakespeare. Coriolanus expresses his
opinion of it when he says to the people:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"What's the matter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in these several places of the city<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You cry against the noble Senate, who,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would feed on one another?"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 2, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<span class='i8'>(Ib.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Junius Brutus tries in vain to argue with him, but
Coriolanus has no patience with him, a "triton of
the minnows"; and the very fact that there should
be tribunes appointed for the people disgusts him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their own choice; one's Junius Brutus,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere so prevailed with me; it will in time<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The common file, a plague!&mdash;Tribunes for them!"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 1, Sc. 6.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Shakespeare took his material for the drama of
"Coriolanus" from Plutarch's "Lives," and it is significant
that he selected from that list of worthies the
most conspicuous adversary of the commonalty that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Rome produced. He presents him to us as a hero,
and, so far as he can, enlists our sympathy for him
from beginning to end. When Menenius says of
him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His nature is too noble for the world,"<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Act 3, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>he is evidently but registering the verdict of the
author. Plutarch's treatment of Coriolanus is far
different. He exhibits his fine qualities, but he
does not hesitate to speak of his "imperious temper
and that savage manner which was too haughty for
a republic." "Indeed," he adds, "there is no other
advantage to be had from a liberal education equal
to that of polishing and softening our nature by reason
and discipline." He also tells us that Coriolanus
indulged his "irascible passions on a supposition
that they have something great and exalted in
them," and that he wanted "a due mixture of gravity
and mildness, which are the chief political virtues
and the fruits of reason and education." "He
never dreamed that such obstinacy is rather the
effect of the weakness and effeminacy of a distempered
mind, which breaks out in violent passions
like so many tumors." Nor apparently did Shakespeare
ever dream of it either, altho he had Plutarch's
sage observations before him. It is a pity that the
great dramatist did not select from Plutarch's
works some hero who took the side of the people,
some Agis or Cleomenes, or, better yet, one of the
Gracchi. What a tragedy he might have based on
the life of Tiberius, the friend of the people and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
martyr in their cause! But the spirit which guided
Schiller in the choice of William Tell for a hero was
a stranger to Shakespeare's heart, and its promptings
would have met with no response there.</p>

<p>Even more striking is the treatment which the
author of "Coriolanus" metes out to English history.
All but two of his English historical dramas are devoted
to the War of the Roses and the incidental
struggle over the French crown. The motive of
this prolonged strife&mdash;so attractive to Shakespeare&mdash;had
much the same dignity which distinguishes
the family intrigues of the Sublime Porte, and
Shakespeare presents the history of his country as a
mere pageant of warring royalties and their trains.
When the people are permitted to appear, as they
do in Cade's rebellion, to which Shakespeare has
assigned the character of the rising under Wat Tyler,
they are made the subject of burlesque. Two of
the popular party speak as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"John Holland. Well, I say, it was never merry world
in England since gentlemen came up.</p>

<p>George Bevis. O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded
in handicraftsmen.</p>

<p>John. The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons."</p></div>

<p>When Jack Cade, alias Wat Tyler, comes on the
scene, he shows himself to be a braggart and a fool.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Be brave then, for your captain is brave and vows
reformation. There shall be in England seven half-penny
loaves sold for a penny; the three-hooped pot shall have
ten hoops, and I will make it a felony to drink small beer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
All the realm shall be in common, and in Cheapside shall
my palfrey go to grass. And when I am king asking I
will be&mdash;</p>

<p>All. God save your majesty!</p>

<p>Cade. I thank you, good people&mdash;there shall be no
money; all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will
apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree like
brothers and worship me their lord."</p>

<p><span class='ref'>(Henry VI., Part 2, Act 4, Sc. 2.)</span></p></div>

<p>The crowd wishes to kill the clerk of Chatham
because he can read, write, and cast accounts. (Cade.
"O monstrous!") Sir Humphrey Stafford calls them</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marked for the gallows."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Ib.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Clifford succeeds without much difficulty in turning
the enmity of the mob against France, and Cade
ejaculates disconsolately, "Was ever a feather so
lightly blown to and fro as this multitude?" (Ib.,
Act 4, Sc. 8.) In the stage directions of this scene,
Shakespeare shows his own opinion of the mob by
writing, "Enter Cade and his rabblement." One
looks in vain here as in the Roman plays for a suggestion
that poor people sometimes suffer wrongfully
from hunger and want, that they occasionally
have just grievances, and that their efforts to present
them, so far from being ludicrous, are the most
serious parts of history, beside which the struttings
of kings and courtiers sink into insignificance.</p>

<p>One of the popular songs in Tyler's rebellion was
the familiar couplet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When Adam delved and Eve span,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was then the gentleman?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Shakespeare refers to it in "Hamlet," where the
grave-diggers speak as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"First Clown. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
gentleman but gardners, ditchers and grave-makers; they
hold up Adam's profession.</p>

<p>Second Clown. Was he a gentleman?</p>

<p>First Clown. He was the first that ever bore arms.</p>

<p>Second Clown. Why, he had none.</p>

<p>First Clown. What, art a heathen? How dost thou
understand the Scripture? The Scripture says, Adam
digged; could he dig without arms?"</p>

<p><span class='ref'>(Act 5, Sc. 1.)</span></p></div>

<p>That Shakespeare's caricature of Tyler's rebellion
is a fair indication of his view of all popular
risings appears from the remarks addressed by
Westmoreland to the Archbishop of York in the
Second Part of "Henry IV." (Act 4, Sc. 1). Says
he:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"If that rebellion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came like itself, in base and abject routs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And countenanced by boys and beggary;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say if damned commotion so appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his true, native, and most proper shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, Reverend Father, and these noble lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not been here to dress the ugly form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of base and bloody insurrection<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With your fair honors."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first and last of Shakespeare's English historical
plays, "King John" and "Henry VIII.," lie
beyond the limits of the civil wars, and each of them
treats of a period momentous in the annals of English
liberty, a fact which Shakespeare absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
ignores. John as king had two great misfortunes&mdash;he
suffered disgrace at the hands of his barons
and of the pope. The first event, the wringing of
Magna Charta from the king, Shakespeare passes
over. A sense of national pride might have excused
the omission of the latter humiliation, but no, it was
a triumph of authority, and as such Shakespeare
must record it for the edification of his hearers, and
consequently we have the king presented on the stage
as meekly receiving the crown from the papal legate
(Act 5, Sc. 1). England was freed from the Roman
yoke in the reign of Henry VIII., and in the drama
of that name Shakespeare might have balanced the
indignity forced upon King John, but now he is
silent. Nothing must be said against authority,
even against that of the pope, and the play culminates
in the pomp and parade of the christening of
the infant Elizabeth! Such is Shakespeare's conception
of history! Who could guess from reading
these English historical plays that throughout the
period which they cover English freedom was growing,
that justice and the rights of man were asserting
themselves, while despotism was gradually
curbed and limited? This is the one great glory of
English history, exhibiting itself at Runnymede, reflected
in Wyclif and John Ball and Wat Tyler, and
shining dimly in the birth of a national church under
the eighth Henry. As Shakespeare wrote, it was
preparing for a new and conspicuous outburst.
When he died, Oliver Cromwell was already seventeen
years of age and John Hampden twenty-two.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
The spirit of Hampden was preeminently the English
spirit&mdash;the spirit which has given distinction to
the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;and he and Shakespeare
were contemporaries, and yet of this spirit not a
vestige is to be found in the English historical plays
and no opportunities lost to obliterate or distort its
manifestations. Only in Brutus and his fellow-conspirators&mdash;of
all Shakespearian characters&mdash;do we
find the least consideration for liberty, and even then
he makes the common, and perhaps in his time the
unavoidable, mistake of overlooking the genuinely
democratic leanings of Julius C&aelig;sar and the anti-popular
character of the successful plot against him.</p>

<p>It has in all ages been a pastime of noble minds
to try to depict a perfect state of society. Forty
years before Shakespeare's birth, Sir Thomas More
published his "Utopia" to the world. Bacon intended
to do the same thing in the "New Atlantis,"
but never completed the work, while Sir Philip Sidney
gives us his dream in his "Arcadia." Montaigne
makes a similar essay, and we quote from
Florio's translation, published in 1603, the following
passage (Montaigne's "Essays," Book I, Chapter
30):</p>

<p>"It is a nation, would I answer Plato, that hath
no kind of traffic, no knowledge of letters, no intelligence
of numbers, no name of magistrate nor of
political superiority; no use of service, of riches, or
of poverty; no contracts, no succession, no dividences;
no occupation, but idle; no respect of kindred,
but common; no apparel, but natural; no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
manuring of lands; no use of wine, corn, or metal.
The very words that import lying, falsehood, treason,
dissimulation, covetousness, envy, detraction,
and pardon were never heard among them."</p>

<p>We may readily infer that Shakespeare found
little to sympathize with in this somewhat extravagant
outline of a happy nation, but he goes out of his way
to travesty it. In "The Tempest" he makes Gonzalo,
the noblest character in the play, hold the following
language to the inevitable king (Shakespeare can
not imagine even a desert island without a king!):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,<br /></span>

<span class='i8'>(Tempest, Act 2, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>That all things are not for the best in the best of
all possible worlds would seem to result from the
wise remarks made by the fishermen who enliven
the scene in "Pericles, Prince of Tyre." They compare
landlords to whales who swallow up everything,
and suggest that the land be purged of "these
drones that rob the bee of her honey"; and Pericles,
so far from being shocked at such revolutionary and
vulgar sentiments, is impressed by their weight, and
speaks kindly of the humble philosophers, who in
their turn are hospitable to the shipwrecked prince&mdash;all
of which un-Shakespearian matter adds doubt
to the authenticity of this drama (Act 2, Sc. 1).</p>

<p>However keen the insight of Shakespeare may have
been into the hearts of his high-born characters, he
had no conception of the unity of the human race.
For him the prince and the peasant were not of the
same blood.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"For princes are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A model, which heaven makes like to itself,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>says King Simonides in "Pericles," and here at least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
we seem to see the hand of Shakespeare (Act 2, Sc.
2). The two princes, Guiderius and Arviragus,
brought up secretly in a cave, show their royal origin
(Cymbeline, Act 3, Sc. 3), and the servants who see
Coriolanus in disguise are struck by his noble figure
(Coriolanus, Act 4, Sc. 5). Bastards are villains as
a matter of course, witness Edmund in "Lear" and
John in "Much Ado about Nothing," and no
degree of contempt is too high for a</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"hedge-born swain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That doth presume to boast of gentle blood."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Henry VI., Part 1, Act 4, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Courage is only to be expected in the noble-born.
The Duke of York says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find no harbor in a royal heart."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Henry VI., Part 2, Act 3, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>In so far as the lower classes had any relation to
the upper classes, it was one, thought Shakespeare,
of dependence and obligation. It was not the tiller
of the soil who fed the lord of the manor, but rather
the lord who supported the peasant. Does not the
king have to lie awake and take thought for his subjects?
Thus Henry V. complains that he can not
sleep</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"so soundly as the wretched slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with a body filled and vacant mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never sees horrid night, the child of Hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But like a lackey, from the rise to set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweats in the eye of Ph&#339;bus, and all night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeps in Elysium....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slave, a member of the country's peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoys it, but in gross brain little wots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hours the peasant best advantages."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Henry V., Act 4, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>And these lines occur at the end of a passage in
which the king laments the "ceremony" that oppresses
him and confesses that but for it he would
be "but a man." He makes this admission, however,
in a moment of danger and depression. Henry
IV. also invokes sleep (Part 2, Act 2, Sc. 1):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In loathsome beds?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But plain people have to watch at times, and the
French sentinel finds occasion to speak in the same
strain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Thus are poor servitors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(When others sleep upon their quiet beds)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Constrained to watch in darkness, rain, and cold."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Henry VI., Part 1, Act 2, Sc. 1.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>Henry VI. is also attracted by the peasant's lot:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O God, methinks it were a happy life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be no better than a homely swain....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... The shepherd's homely curds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As far beyond a prince's delicates."<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>(Henry VI., Part 3, Act 2, Sc. 5.)</span>
</div></div>

<p>All of which is natural enough, but savors of cant
in the mouths of men who fought long and hard to
maintain themselves upon their thrones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>We have already shown by references to the contemporary
drama that the plea of custom is not sufficient
to explain Shakespeare's attitude to the lower
classes, but if we widen our survey to the entire field
of English letters in his day, we shall see that he was
running counter to all the best traditions of our literature.
From the time of Piers Plowman down,
the peasant had stood high with the great writers of
poetry and prose alike. Chaucer's famous circle of
story-tellers at the Tabard Inn in Southwark was
eminently democratic. With the knight and the
friar were gathered together</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"An haberdasher and a carpenter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A webbe, a deyer and tapiser,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and the tales of the cook and the miller take rank
with those of the squire and lawyer. The English
Bible, too, was in Shakespeare's hands, and he must
have been familiar with shepherd kings and fishermen-apostles.
In the very year in which "Hamlet"
first appeared, a work was published in Spain which
was at once translated into English, a work as well
known to-day as Shakespeare's own writings. If
the peasantry was anywhere to be neglected and
despised, where should it be rather than in proud,
aristocratic Spain, and yet, to place beside Shakespeare's
Bottoms and Slys, Cervantes has given us
the admirable Sancho Panza, and has spread his
loving humor in equal measure over servant and
master. Are we to believe that the yeomen of England,
who beat back the Armada, were inferior to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the Spanish peasantry whom they overcame, or is it
not rather true that the Spanish author had a deeper
insight into his country's heart than was allotted to
the English dramatist? Cervantes, the soldier and
adventurer, rose above the prejudices of his class,
while Shakespeare never lifted his eyes beyond the
narrow horizon of the Court to which he catered.
It was love that opened Cervantes's eye, and it is in
all-embracing love that Shakespeare was deficient.
As far as the common people were concerned, he
never held the mirror up to nature.</p>

<p>But the book of all others which might have suggested
to Shakespeare that there was more in the
claims of the lower classes than was dreamt of in his
philosophy was More's "Utopia," which in its English
form was already a classic. More, the richest and
most powerful man in England after the king, not
only believed in the workingman, but knew that he
suffered from unjust social conditions. He could
never have represented the down-trodden followers
of Cade-Tyler nor the hungry mob in "Coriolanus"
with the utter lack of sympathy which Shakespeare
manifests. "What justice is there in this," asks the
great Lord Chancellor, whose character stood the
test of death&mdash;"what justice is there in this, that a
nobleman, a goldsmith, a banker, or any other man,
that either does nothing at all or at best is employed
in things that are of no use to the public, should live
in great luxury and splendor upon what is so ill acquired;
and a mean man, a carter, a smith, a plowman,
that works harder even than the beasts them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>selves,
and is employed on labors so necessary that
no commonwealth could hold out a year without
them, can only earn so poor a livelihood, and must
lead so miserable a life, that the condition of the
beasts is much better than theirs?"</p>

<p>How different from this is Shakespeare's conception
of the place of the workingman in society!
After a full and candid survey of his plays, Bottom,
the weaver with the ass's head, remains his type of
the artizan and the "mutable, rank-scented many,"
his type of the masses. Is it unfair to take the misshapen
"servant-monster" Caliban as his last word
on the subject?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2>LETTER FROM
MR. G. BERNARD SHAW</h2>

<h3>(Extracts)</h3>


<p>As you know, I have striven hard to open English
eyes to the emptiness of Shakespeare's philosophy,
to the superficiality and second-handedness of
his morality, to his weakness and incoherence as a
thinker, to his snobbery, his vulgar prejudices, his
ignorance, his disqualifications of all sorts for the
philosophic eminence claimed for him.... The
preface to my "Three Plays for Puritans" contains
a section headed "Better than Shakespeare?" which
is, I think, the only utterance of mine on the subject
to be found in a book.... There is at present in
the press a new preface to an old novel of mine called
"The Irrational Knot." In that preface I define
the first order in Literature as consisting of those
works in which the author, instead of accepting the
current morality and religion ready-made without
any question as to their validity, writes from an original
moral standpoint of his own, thereby making
his book an original contribution to morals, religion,
and sociology, as well as to <i>belles letters</i>. I place
Shakespeare with Dickens, Scott, Dumas p&egrave;re, etc.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in the second order, because, tho they are enormously
entertaining, their morality is ready-made; and I
point out that the one play, "Hamlet," in which
Shakespeare made an attempt to give as a hero one
who was dissatisfied with the ready-made morality,
is the one which has given the highest impression of
his genius, altho Hamlet's revolt is unskillfully and
inconclusively suggested and not worked out with
any philosophic competence.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>May I suggest that you should be careful not to
imply that Tolstoy's great Shakespearian heresy
has no other support than mine. The preface of
Nicholas Rowe to his edition of Shakespeare, and
the various prefaces of Dr. Johnson contain, on
Rowe's part, an apology for him as a writer with obvious
and admitted shortcomings (very ridiculously
ascribed by Rowe to his working by "a mere light
of nature"), and, on Johnson's, a good deal of downright
hard-hitting criticism. You should also look
up the history of the Ireland forgeries, unless, as is
very probable, Tolstoy has anticipated you in this.
Among nineteenth-century poets Byron and William
Morris saw clearly that Shakespeare was enormously
overrated intellectually. A French book, which has
been translated into English, has appeared within
the last ten years, giving Napoleon's opinions of the
drama. His insistence on the superiority of Corneille
to Shakespeare on the ground of Corneille's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
power of grasping a political situation, and of seeing
men in their relation to the state, is interesting.</p>

<p>Of course you know about Voltaire's criticisms,
which are the more noteworthy because Voltaire
began with an extravagant admiration for Shakespeare,
and got more and more bitter against him as
he grew older and less disposed to accept artistic
merit as a cover for philosophic deficiencies.</p>

<p>Finally, I, for one, shall value Tolstoy's criticism
all the more because it is criticism of a foreigner
who can not possibly be enchanted by the mere word-music
which makes Shakespeare so irresistible in
England.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In Tolstoy's estimation, Shakespeare
must fall or stand as a thinker, in which capacity I
do not think he will stand a moment's examination
from so tremendously keen a critic and religious
realist. Unfortunately, the English worship their
great artists quite indiscriminately and abjectly; so
that is quite impossible to make them understand
that Shakespeare's extraordinary literary power, his
fun, his mimicry, and the endearing qualities that
earned him the title of "the gentle Shakespeare"&mdash;all
of which, whatever Tolstoy may say, are quite
unquestionable facts&mdash;do not stand or fall with his
absurd reputation as a thinker. Tolstoy will certainly
treat that side of his reputation with the severity
it deserves; and you will find that the English
press will instantly announce that Tolstoy considers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
his own works greater than Shakespeare's (which in
some respects they most certainly are, by the way),
and that he has attempted to stigmatize our greatest
poet as a liar, a thief, a forger, a murderer, an
incendiary, a drunkard, a libertine, a fool, a madman,
a coward, a vagabond, and even a man of questionable
gentility. You must not be surprised or
indignant at this: it is what is called "dramatic criticism"
in England and America. Only a few of
the best of our journalist-critics will say anything
worth reading on the subject.</p>

<p class='big30'>Tolstoy's Essays<br />
and Letters</p>

<h2>By LEO TOLSTOY</h2>

<h3>Translated by AYLMER MAUDE</h3>

<p>This work contains twenty-six essays and letters
(many published for the first time) belonging to
the last fifteen years of Tolstoy's career, the period in
which he has devoted himself exclusively to humanitarian
labors. Therefore each has a definite altruistic
purpose. In the letters in particular we have, in the
words of the translator, "Tolstoy's opinions in application
to certain definite conditions. They thus help to
bridge the gulf between theory and practise."</p>

<h3>HIGHLY COMMENDED</h3>

<p class='big30'>Tolstoy's Plays</p>

<h3>Also Annotated List of Works</h3>

<p>This volume, a new translation by Louise and Aylmer
Maude, contains Tolstoy's three great plays, together
with the Russian folk-tale of which one of them is the
dramatized version. It also includes a complete annotated
and chronological list of Tolstoy's works of special helpfulness
to all readers and students of the great Russian writer.</p>

<h3>LIST OF THE PLAYS</h3>

<p><b>The Power of Darkness</b>; or, If a Claw is Caught the Bird is
Lost&mdash;A drama in five acts.</p>

<p><b>The First Distiller</b>&mdash;A comedy in six acts.</p>

<p><b>Fruits of Culture</b>&mdash;A comedy in four acts.</p>

<h3>INCLUDING ALSO</h3>

<p class='center'><b>The Imp and the Crust</b>&mdash;This is a Russian folk-tale, of which<br />
"The First Distiller" is the dramatized version.</p>

<h4>Their High Literary and Dramatic Value</h4>

<p>To their literary merit Tolstoy's plays add the quality of being
excellent acting dramas, as their success both in Russia
and elsewhere has abundantly shown. Mr. Laurence Irving
lately wrote: "I suppose England is the only country in Europe
where 'The Power of Darkness' has not been acted. It ought
to be done. It is a stupendous tragedy; the effect on the stage
is unparalleled."</p>

<h4>Their Wide Range of Sentiment</h4>

<p>"Between Tolstoy's two great plays," says the translator,
"'The Power of Darkness' and 'The Fruits of Culture,' the
contrast is very striking. The first is intensely moral, terrible
in its earnestness and force.... Very different is 'Fruits of
Culture,' a play brimful of laughter and merriment."</p>

<p>Each essay in this volume expresses, in one form
or other, Tolstoy's views of life; and the main
object of the book is not to praise his views, but to
explain them. Being the only Englishman who in
recent years has had the advantage of intimate personal
intercourse, continued over a period of some
years, with Tolstoy, Mr. Maude is well qualified for
his present work.</p>

<p class='big40'>Sevastopol</p>
<h2><span class='smcap'>AND OTHER MILITARY TALES</span></h2>

<h3>By LEO TOLSTOY</h3>

<p>A new translation by Louise and Aylmer Maude,
specially approved by the author. This book
relates the author's own experiences, sensations, and
reflections during the most noted siege of modern history.
The translation has been authorized by Count
Tolstoy, who has specially commended it for its accuracy,
simplicity, and directness.</p>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>"No other modern book approaches 'Sevastopol' in the
completeness and directness with which it unveils the realities
of war. There are picturesque glimpses in Mr. Kipling's
vulgar stories of fighting. But the strongest meat Mr. Kipling
can provide is milk for babes beside Count Tolstoy's
seemingly casual sketches, which yet comprehend with
merciless amplitude the whole atmosphere of war."&mdash;<i>The
Morning Leader</i>, London.</p></div>

<h3>What Count Tolstoy Says of the Translators<br />
and Translation</h3>

<div class="blockquot2"><p>"Better translators, both for knowledge of the two languages
and for penetration into the very meaning of the
matter translated, could not be invented." Of their translation
of Sevastopol, Tolstoy also says: "I think I already
wrote you how unusually the first volume of your edition
pleases me. All in it is excellent: the edition and the remarks,
and chiefly the translation, and yet more the conscientiousness
with which all this has been done."</p></div>

<h1>King of Assyria, and Other Stories</h1>

<h2><i>By</i> COUNT LEO TOLSTOY</h2>

<p class='center'><i>Translated by Louise and Aylmer Maude, with an Introduction<br />
Containing Letters by Tolstoy</i></p>

<p><b>Esarhaddon, King of Assyria.</b> An allegorical story with an
Oriental setting, telling how a cruel king was made to feel
and understand the sufferings of one of his captives, and to
repent his own cruelty.</p>

<p><b>Work, Death, and Sickness.</b> A legend accredited to the
South American Indians, showing the three means God took
to make men more kind and brotherly toward each other.</p>

<p><b>Three Questions.</b> A quaint folk-lore tale answering the
three questions of life: "What is the Best Time?" "Who
Are the Most Important Persons?" "What Thing Should
be Done First?"</p>

<h3>OPINION OF THE PRESS</h3>

<div class="blockquot2"><p><i>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</i>: "Count Tolstoy is a man so sure of his
message and so clear about it that he always finds something worth
while to say.... There is a quality in the little tales published under
the title 'Esarhaddon' which is quickly suggestive of certain Biblical
narratives. There is one called 'Three Questions,' which contains, in
half a dozen pages, an entire philosophy of life, and it is presented in
such apt pictures and ideas that its meaning is not to be overlooked. It
would be hard to suggest anything that could be read in five minutes
that would impart so much to think about. 'Esarhaddon,' the sketch
from which the volume takes its name, is of the same character, and
the third tale, 'Work, Death, and Sickness,' is full of very fine thought.
There is, perhaps, no writer working to-day whose mind is centered on
broader and better things than the Russian master, and the present
offering shows him at his very best."</p></div>

<p class='big40'>What Is Art?</p>

<h3>Translated from the Original Manuscript, with<br />
an Introduction by AYLMER MAUDE</h3>

<p>Art is a human activity, declares Tolstoy. The object
of this activity is to transmit to others feelings
the artist has experienced. By certain external signs&mdash;movements,
lines, colors, sounds or arrangements of
words&mdash;an artist infects other people so that they share
his feelings; thus, "art is a means of union among men,
joining them together in the same feeling." Without
adequate expression there is no art, for there is no infection,
no transference to others of the author's feeling.
The test of art is infection. If an author has moved you
so that you feel as he felt, if you are so united to him in
feeling that it seems to you that he has expressed just
what you have long wished to express, the work that has
so infected you is a work of art.</p>
